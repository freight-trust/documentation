3.  Bandwidth is definite

4.  The network is unsecure

5.  Topology does change

6.  There are multiple administrators

7.  Transport cost is non-zero

8.  The network is heterogeneous

# Network Terms

We define the term High Availability in the common colloquial sense
found in the database community where a database is highly available if
it can fail over to an active replica on the fly with no downtime,
rather than the definition of high availability used in the CAP theorem
which requires that even minority replicas remain available during a
network partition.

Data Integrity guarantees Not the Data Availability Gguarantees

# Network Axioms

Data = Time

Data = Immutable

Time == Immutable

Latency \!= Availability

The structure of any system designed by an organization is isomorphic to
the structure of the organization.

When a settled system is disturbed, it will adjust to diminish the
change that has been made to it. Any change in status quo prompts an
opposing reaction in the responding system.
