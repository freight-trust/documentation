TradeDocs.org `StandardDocument` (abbreviated as `StanDoc`)
is a family of document models that forms the basis
of Freight Trust's `TradeDoc`, which is used to represent our legal parity digital smart contracts. These documents are based off of ISO Standards and
similarly structured standards.
It itself is an instantiation of
https://github.com/metanorma/basicdoc-models[`BasicDocument` (`BasicDoc`)]

These are the principle `document structures` that form the basis for our `primitives`.

`TradeDocs` itself is a document model can form the basis of multiple
standard document types, including:

* Bills of Lading
* Warehouse Receipts
* Letters of Credit
* Forward Contracts
* Advanced Manifests
* Bill of Materials
* and more...

The Relaton Bibliography UML models used within these models are located here:
