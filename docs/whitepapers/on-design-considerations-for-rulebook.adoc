To a lawyer, a legal contract has a distinct meaning:

----
A contract is an agreement giving rise to obligations which are enforced or recognised by law. The
factor which distinguishes contractual from other legal obligations is that they are based on the
agreement of the contracting parties7.
For a contract to be valid, legal systems will impose certain requirements. Under English law, there
are four key elements that must (usually) be satisfied: (i) one of the contracting parties must make
an offer to contract and the other(s) must accept that offer; (ii) there must be ‘consideration’ for the
offer, this being some form of value that must be exchanged; (iii) the parties must have an intention
to form legal relations; and (iv) there must be certainty as to terms of the contract. Other systems of
law may have other requirements – for example, under New York law, many legal contracts must be
in writing and signed to become binding.

Clause <#>  – Choice of law: lex mercatoria and Unidroit Principles

This contract is governed by general principles of law generally recognized in
international trade (lex mercatoria) together with the Unidroit Principles of
International Commercial Contracts (except for Articles 2.20, 3.2.7 and 6.2.1).

Clause 6.1
“Any questions relating to this Agreement which are not expressly or implicitly settled
by the provisions contained in this Agreement shall be governed, in the following
order:
1) by the principles of law generally recognized in international trade as applicable to
international [type of contract: e.g., distributorship, licence] contracts,
2) by the relevant trade usages, and
3) by the Unidroit Principles of International Commercial Contracts,
with the exclusion of national laws.”
This clause, which is the most frequently used clause within the ICC model contracts,
states that the contract shall be governed by the lex mercatoria and the Unidroit
Principles and provides at the same time the following hierarchical order:
1. Contract provisions,
2. general principles of law applicable to the particular type of contract in question,
3. trade usages,
4. Unidroit Principles.

=== Four Principles in creating IoL

_Four principles appear to be desirable and should insofar as it is possible be pursued together:_

. the promotion of certainty and predictability;
. the promotion of uniformity of application;
. the protection of democratic ideals andensuring of jurisprudential deliberation,
. the retention of efficiency.

Systems based approach

Often when two companies deal with each other in the course of business, they will use standard form contracts.
Often these standard forms contain terms which conflict (e.g.
both parties include a liability waiver in their form).
The 'battle of the forms' refers to the resulting legal dispute arising where both parties accept that a legally binding contract exists, but disagree about whose standard terms apply.
Such disputes may be resolved by reference to the 'last document rule', i.e.
whichever business sent the last document, or 'fired the last shot' (often the seller's delivery note) is held to have issued the final offer and the buyer's organisation is held to have accepted the offer by signing the delivery note or simply accepting and using the delivered goods.

serve the purpose of maininting a neutral legal framework.

Rules...

* that address problems that have not been defined
* that address problems that no longer exist
* that address more than one problem
* that lack a stated, measurable problemsolving goal, or purpose
* Laws that fail to achieve their goal
* Laws that lack a citation of references
* whose burdens are greater than their problemsolving benefit
* whose problemsolving benefit and burdens are equal
* whose results cannot be measured
* that interfere with other laws
* that duplicate other laws
* that have not undergone QA analysis within a specified time frame or approval process
