??? note "Purpose"
	The modern digital business works in real time; it informs interested parties of things of interest when they happen, it makes sense of, and derives insight from an ever-growing number of sources. It learns, predicts and is intelligent -- it is by nature Event Driven.Event-driven architecture (EDA) is an architecture pattern that promotes the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events. This architectural pattern can be applied to the systems that transmit events among loosely coupled software components and services. 


## Overview

* Pass on to the customer the savings introduced by efficiencies
* Innovate pricing thanks to marketplace mechanism and data
* Build mechanisms that support suppliers of all size
* Invest in creating a mechanism that brings the best to the top (i.e. rate of failure)
* Invest in mechanisms for empowerment, augmenting workers potential

## Freight Trust Network Overview

We adopt a “cryptoasset” pricing model, evaluate our current token
model, and propose several changes in order to maximize value accrual as
the network opens for public (i.e. business) usage. Much of this work is
based on sources found at the end, and we would like to thank everyone
who offered their critiques and thoughts on the subject.

Examining the “bifurcated” token model (having 2 tokens: a transactional
token (network native) and a “system” token (erc-20) is shown to be a
better model than a traditional singular token model.

#### Protocol

> On Protocols
    
    > "Protocols encode the rules of engagement that coordinate the
    > exchange of a service between a global supplier and global
    > consumer."
    > 
    > —  Chris Burniske Protocols As Minimally Extractive Coordinators 

Protocols provide structure for businesses, but are not businesses
themselves; they are systems of logic that coordinate exchange between
suppliers (businesses) and consumers of a service. As coordinators of
exchange, protocols should be minimally extractive, whereas businesses
are incentivized to be maximally extractive (that’s profit, and a
business is valued as a multiple of its profit). The ERC-20 token, $EDI,
acts as a right to receive the native network asset, xEDI on demand.
xEDI does not act as a right to receive any other asset, instead, it
grants the right to transact on the network-based upon market conditions
and pricing. This does not preclude a trading mechanism from existing:
we simply enforce a one-way mechanism for EDI to xEDI.

### Nodes

Masternodes == Nodes. All nodes are technically the same. The
classifications below are more specifically `slots`. Nodes are rotated
into different `slot positions` over an `epoch`. An `epoch` is defined
in terms of `checkpoint increment` authority: concensus signing node
validator: failover

### Nodlet

There are 4 maine classes of `nodes`. A `master-node` and the 3 `nodelets`

#### Sub Node Classes

+ besu-tx: Handling of local transaction pool. 
+ besu-sync: Handling of blockchain synchronisation through Ethereum P2P network. 
+ besu-query: Handling of database queries.

## Threshold Utility Level

The `ERC-20` token, `$EDI`, can enable access to the network level
operator system, commonly referred to as "master nodes". This is both a
network and a legal operation as operators are part of a limited
partnership that is compensated from Freight Trust Inc.

Network operation is distributed amongst “Master Nodes”. An amount of
$EDI is required, x, in order to be able to be eligible for hosting part
of the main network.

## Categories for Network Operations

``` json
[
    {"Category":"Nodes","Item":"Authority,Validator,Failover"},
    {"Category":"Nodlet","Item":"query,sync,transaction"},
    {"Category":"Staking","Item":"Operator,Pool"}
]
```

## End-market fundamentals

In our use case, we assume that the platform will accrue transaction
volumes at a consistent dollar rate per user transaction set (e.g. EDI
transaction to a trading partner). This transaction volume would likely
be composed of an end-user directly paying for the transaction on a per
kilobyte basis.

**Value flows being distributed in the native cryptoasset requires an
exogenous assumption to form a base of value**, and even then, the
supply-side’s assessment of the value they’re receiving can be
unpredictable given the native asset’s volatility. We can make the
assumption that at equilibrium the service should be 1/10th the cost of
a service provisioned by a company comparable (e.g., storage at 1/10th
the cost of AWS), as only networks that are more efficient than
companies will be able to get demand-sides to make the leap. The cost of
the service can then be pinpointed, the units of the service consumed
can be projected, and the product of the two is the value stream flowing
to the supply-side.

That value stream is what the cryptocapital has claim to, and so the
capital asset component of value can be assessed. The “outside” anchor
is the cost of comparable services that the cryptonetwork (freight trust
network) will be competing with, though trouble remains if the native
cryptoasset is too volatile, as that volatility influences the
supply-sides’ perception of what they’re getting paid. Freight Trust,
Inc includes a few “legacy” mechanisms to address this point, such as
payment to node operators in fiat, thus establishing a fixed cost floor.

### Governance

Governance mechanisms in general should:
1\) Attract a willing
supply-side that produces the resource (node operators, stakeholders,
community et al)

2\) Connect that resource to a demand-side that values and is willing to
pay for the resource (businesses)

3\) It creates an open layer of access to the underlying resource for
distributors that want to build the last mile to the consumer. (Freight
Trust Corporate) As of right now, no formal governance mechanism besides
the informal RFC process exists for EDI. We plan in the following days
to formally propose a new governance mechanism based upon Dynamic
Alignment. We have included a graphic to illustrate the idea behind it
