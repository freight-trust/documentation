??? note "Purpose"
	The modern digital business works in real time; it informs interested parties of things of interest when they happen, it makes sense of, and derives insight from an ever-growing number of sources. It learns, predicts and is intelligent -- it is by nature Event Driven.Event-driven architecture (EDA) is an architecture pattern that promotes the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events. This architectural pattern can be applied to the systems that transmit events among loosely coupled software components and services. 


## Overview 

* Lower transaction cost to drive evolution in markets
* Look for fragmented markets as an opportunity to seek for efficiencies
* Pass on to the customer the savings introduced by efficiencies
* Innovate pricing thanks to marketplace mechanism and data
* Build mechanisms that support suppliers of all size
* Invest in creating a mechanism that brings the best to the top (i.e. rate of failure)
* Invest in mechanisms for empowerment, augmenting workers potential
