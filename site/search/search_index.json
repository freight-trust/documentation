All memory locations are initially zero. Program code is stored in a ROM, not easily accessible Jumps A JUMP or JUMPI instruction sets the program counter and therefore starts execution off again from some newly- specified instruction. These must jump to some explicit JUMPDEST instruction, that is not an argument literal of another instruction. Exceptions There is only one type of exception. If one occurs, return to the state prior to the current execution, but consume all gas. Exceptions may occur in any of the following circumstances: There is insufficient remaining gas to cover the cost of an instruction; An undefined instruction is to be executed; A jump to an invalid destination occurs. The stack size would exceed 1024 if the next instruction were to be executed Fees Gas fees may be charged for the following reasons: Intrinsic fees charged for computation performed by each instruction gas may be deducted to pay for a subordinate contract call or creation gas may be paid to compensate for extra memory usage Execution Environment The currently executing contract has access to a tuple I , with the following fields: I_a : the address of the account owning the executing code I_o : the address of the transaction originating this execution I_p : the gas price in the originating transaction I_d : a byte array of the input data I_s : sender address I_v : the value ( in wei ) passed to this account I_b : the byte array containing the machine code to be executed I_H : the current block header I_e : the current contract stack depth ( number of CALL and CREATE instructions that have been executed ) The memory state \u03bc , of the currently running contract, is itself subdivided thus: \u03bc _s : the stack , holds up to 1024 words ; initially empty \u03bc _m : memory contents , initially implicitly 2 ^ 256 bytes of zeroes ( word - addressed byte array , words stored big - endian ); \u03bc _g : remaining gas \u03bc _pc : The program counter ( a positive 256 bit integer ) \u03bc _i : the size of the active memory region in words We also have a substate A, maintained during execution, which contains the following fields (initially empty or zero): A_s : The suicide set . Accounts to be discarded following transaction completion . A_l : Log series . archived and indexable \"checkpoints\" that help contract calls to be tracked . A_r : Refund balance , accrued by setting nonzero values in \u03c3 to zero , using the SSTORE instruction . Execution At each instruction, gas fees are charged, state is update, and the program counter increments (or jumps). Instructions Definitions \u03bc : the EVM 's memory; by a slight overloading of terms, this shall mean the same thing as \u03bc_m , above. If a value v is said to be saved to memory at address \u03b1, this means \u03bc[\u03b1] <- v. If v is a word, it is saved in big- endian order in the address range [\u03b1, \u03b1 + 31]. \u03c4 : the EVM' s execution stack ; the same thing as \u03bc_s , above . We have \u03c4 [ 0 ] the top stack element , and \u03c4 [ k ] the element k from the top . If an instruction pops m values off the stack and pushes n values onto it , this behaviour will be denoted - m + n in the table . The size of the stack aer an operation is then ( n - m ). The result of operations is usually pushed to the stack . \u03c1 : the persistent storage available to the executing account . This is equivalent to \u03c3 [ I_a ] . I_d : a byte array of extra data that may have been included with the transaction as input to the currently running contract . I_b : the bytecode of the currently running contract . wei : the smallest denomination of the ether currency ether . 10 ^ 18 wei constitutes one ether . All ether values will be given in wei . Behaviour will mostly be given approximately, and in English. See the yellow paper for precise definitions.

EDI Costs Versus Benefits A paper purchase order requires resources to print the document, fax it, or post it to the vendor. EDI automatically sends the electronic document to the vendor thus reducing the cost of sending the PO. Studies of the cost savings of implementing EDI have been performed, including a report from the Aberdeen group in 2008, which highlighted that in the US it cost $37.45 to produce and send a paper PO, while it only cost $23.83 to send it using EDI. Not all companies use EDI. There is a cost to implement and maintain the technology required to perform EDI. Each trading partner that a company wants to use EDI with may require resources to set up and this can be cost-prohibitive for smaller companies or companies without technical resources. EDI How It Works There are a number of ways EDI messages are transmitted between trading partners. The most common method was to use a value-added network or VAN. This allowed companies to send a transmission which was then reviewed by the VAN and then sent to the correct recipient. Think of Freight Trust Network as a Value Added Network More recently a new method for EDI transmission is being used. This is called AS2, which stands for Applicability Statement 2, and was championed by Wal-Mart, who requires all of their vendors to use this method. Using AS2, the EDI documents are transmitted across the internet and the security of the document is achieved by encryption and the use of digital certificates. There are dozens of EDI documents that can be implemented by a company and their trading partners. Under the ANSI ASC X12 standard, EDI documents are part of a series, for example, such as an order series, a warehousing series, or a financial series. Many companies will only implement a small number of EDI documents with their trading partners, commonly in the ordering series, material handling series and the delivery series. We have over 20,000 mappings and counting, think of us not only as a Value Added Network, but a Marketplace where you can quickly get and start selling to other businesses For example a company who is implementing EDI between themselves and a third party logistics company may only implement five EDI documents such as an EDI 940 for a warehouse shipping order, EDI 943 for a warehouse stock transfer shipment advice, EDI 944 for a warehouse stock transfer receipt advice, EDI 945 for a warehouse shipping advice, and EDI 947 for a warehouse inventory adjustment advice.

Policies for scheduling network upgrades outside these windows are also described. This is a modified document from EIP-1872 Abstract Four different weeks, spaced roughly evenly throughout the year, are targeted for network upgrades to be launched. Regular network upgrades should announce their intention to launch in a particular window early in their process and choose a block number four to six weeks prior to that window. If a network upgrade is cancelled then it would be rescheduled for the next window. Not all windows will be used. Priority upgrades outside the roadmap may be scheduled in the third week of any month, but such use is discouraged. Critical upgrades are scheduled as needed. Motivation The aim of this NIP is to provide some level of regularity and predictability to the Freight Trust network upgrade/hard fork process. This will allow service providers such as exchanges and node operators a predictable framework to schedule activities around. This also provides a framework to regularize the delivery of network upgrades. Specification Scheduling is defined for three categories of network upgrades. First are Roadmap network upgrades that include deliberate protocol improvements. Next are Priority network updates, where there are technical reasons that necessitate a prompt protocol change but these reasons do not present a systemic risk to the protocol or the ecosystem. Finally, Critical network upgrades are to address issues that present a systemic risk to the protocol or the ecosystem. Network Upgrades Roadmap network upgrades are network upgrades that are deliberate and measured to improve the protocol and ecosystem. Historical examples are Homestead, Byzantium, and Constantinople. Upgrade Scheduling Upgrades should be scheduled in one of four windows: the week with the third Wednesday in January, April, July, and October. When initiating a network upgrade or early in the planning process a particular window should be targeted. Note to reviewers: The months and week chosen are to provide an initial recommendation and are easily modifiable prior to final call. They thread the needle between many third quarter and fourth quarter holidays. Operational Implementation Implementors are expected to have software for a Roadmap network upgrade ready two to four weeks prior to the upgrade. Hence a block number for the network upgrade should be chosen four to six weeks prior to the network upgrade window. Scheduling details such as whether this choice is made prior to or after testnet deployment are out of scope of this NIP. Depending on the release cadence of Roadmap network upgrades some windows will not be used. For example if a six month release cadence is chosen a roadmap upgrade would not occur in adjacent upgrade windows. Hence for a six month cadence if a roadmap upgrade occurred in April then the July window would not be used for network upgrades. If a planned roadmap upgrade needs to be rescheduled then strong consideration should be given to rescheduling the upgrade for the next window in three months time. For the case of a six month cadence this may cause releases to be in adjacent release windows. For a three month cadence the next network upgrade would be merged with the current upgrade or the next network upgrade would be delayed. To be compatible with the scheduled release windows the cadence of the Roadmap Network Upgrades should be a multiple of three months. Whether it is three, six, nine, or more month cadence is out of scope of this NIP. Emergency Procedures Priority Network Upgrades Priority network upgrades are reserved for upgrades that require more urgency than a roadmap network upgrade yet do not present a systemic risk to the network or the ecosystem. To date there have been no examples of a priority upgrade. Possible examples may include roadmap upgrades that need to occur in multiple upgrades or for security risks that have a existing mitigation in place that would be better served by a network upgrade. Priority network upgrades are best launched in unused roadmap launch windows, namely the third week of January, April, July, and October. If necessary they may be launched in the third week of any month, but strong consideration and preference should be given to unused roadmap launch windows. Priority network upgrades should be announced and a block chosen far enough in advance so major clients implementors can release software with the needed block number in a timely fashion. These releases should occur at least a week before the launch window. Hence priority launch windows should be chosen two to four weeks in advance. Critical Upgrades Critical Network Upgrades Critical network upgrades are network upgrades that are designed to address systemic risks to the protocol or to the ecosystem. Historical examples include Dao Fork, Tangerine Whistle, and Spurious Dragon. This NIP provides neither guidance nor restrictions to the development and deployment of these emergency hard forks. These upgrades are typically launched promptly after a solution to the systemic risk is agreed upon between the client implementors. It is recommended that such upgrades perform the minimum amount of changes needed to address the issues that caused the need for the Critical network upgrade and that other changes be integrated into subsequent Priority and Roadmap network upgrades. Network Upgrade Block Number Choice When choosing an activation block the number can be used to communicate the role of a particular network in the Freight Trust Network and in general the Ethereum Ecosystem (mainnet=foundation). Networks that serve as a value store or are otherwise production grade have different stability concerns than networks that serve as technology demonstration or are explicitly designated for testing. To date all Mainnet activation blocks have ended in three or more zeros, including Critical Network Upgrades for the Ethereum Foundation. To continue this pattern network upgrade activation block numbers for mainnet deployments and production grade networks should chose a number whose base 10 representation ends with three or more zeros. Network Upgrade Nomenclature For testnet and testing or development grades network operators are encouraged to choose a block activation number that is a palindrome in base 10. Block numbers for Roadmap and Priority network upgrades should be chosen so that it is forecast to occur relatively close to Wednesday at 12:00 UTC+0 during the launch window. This should result in an actual block production occurring sometime between Monday and Friday of the chosen week. Activation Numbers Activation Numbers for Freight Trust Network Network Procedure mainnet three or more zeros (3+ 0\u2019s) testnets palindrome in base 10. Rationale The rationale for defining launch windows is to give business running Freight Trust infrastructure a predictable schedule for when upgrades may or may not occur. Knowing when a upgrade is not going to occur gives the businesses a clear time frame within which to perform internal upgrades free from external changes. It also provides a timetable for developers and IT professionals to schedule time off against. Backwards Compatibility (Ethereum Foundation Network) Except for the specific launch windows the previous network upgrades would have complied with these policies. Homestead, Byzantium, and Constantinople would have been Roadmap Network Upgrades. There were no Priority Network Upgrades. Dao Fork was a Critical Network Upgrade in response to TheDao. Tangerine Whistle and Spurious Dragon were critical upgrades in response to the Shanghai Spam Attacks. Constantinople Fix (as it is termed in the reference tests) was in response to the https://eips.ethereum.org/ ( EIP-1283 security issues. If this policy were in place prior to Constantinople then the initial 2018 launch would likely have been bumped to the next window after the Ropsten testnet consensus failures. The NIP-1283 issues likely would have resulted in an out of window upgrade because of the impact of the difficulty bomb. Implementation The windows in this NIP are expected to start after the Istanbul Network upgrade, which is the next planned Roadmap upgrade (aka hard forks) should be performed within.

System 2 Deals with the inevitable problems which emerge as a number of autonomous, self-organising operational parts interact. There will be conflicts of interest which must be resolved. System 2 is there to harmonise the interactions, to keep the peace, to deal with the problems. Without a System 2, the system would shake itself to pieces. System 3 Concerned with synergy. It looks at the entire interacting cluster of operational units from its meta-systemic perspective and considers ways to maximise its effectiveness through collaboration. System 3 ensures the whole system works better than the operational parts working in isolation. It represents all of the structures that are put in place by senior leadership to dictate rules, rights, resources and responsibilities within System 1, and also to provide an interface for interaction with Systems 4 and 5. This system represents the broad view of all the operations active within the first system. In simple terms, it is the everyday control of the organisation which is exerted by senior leaders. There is little variety within the activities which occur within the third system. System 4 Ensures the whole system can adapt to a rapidly changing and sometimes hostile environment. It scans the outside world in which it operates, looks for threats and opportunities, undertakes research and simulations, and proposes plans to guide the system through the various possible pathways it could follow. Without a System 4, the system would be unable to cope with the complexity of the external environment in which it operates. In essence it is responsible for looking externally from the organisation or overall system, at the environment in which it operates, and establishing which factors may impact operations, and how it needs to adapt in order to remain viable and sustainable. There are also channels leading each way between System 4 and System 3, as any necessary changes must be implemented through flow down towards the Control systems, but also System 3 must provide information regarding the organisation in its current form.

This system should always be maintained as separate from the control exerted by System 3. System 5 monitors the interaction between S3 and S4 to ensure all plans are within policy guidelines.

Equivalent Equivalent would be where your contractual rights are enforceable, such as a loan that defaults asserting your rights. Parity Parity would mean that it does the exact behavior of actual legal contracts, in that it also involves 3 rd parties into the process, e.g. insurance companies. Now that we have the terminology to be able to express the legaliness, we can move onto the network itself. First, let's define what an effective network is, as that is our ultimate goal: none of this will be useful if the network itself is not an effective regime. The effectiveness of any network or regime (Barrett 2003) is a function of three factors: The ambition of its provisions The level of participation between actors The degree to which actors comply with this framework In designing version 2 of the protocol we had to set forth some design criteria to be able to model not only user behavior but also to help in planning long term priorities in terms of what we should focus on so that we may realize this. Taking a mathematical approach to smart contract design is useful in this attempt as it provides us with criteria that we can and can not do. Quote \"\u2026that a rule constitutes a legal obligation and that compliance is therefore required rather > than merely optional . \" (Hart 1994) \" equivalence \" as it relates to the digitization of shipping documents concerns itself with the term ' functionally equivalent '. It is used in the literature (Goldby 2012) to imply a sort of symmetry to these issues of physicality and possession. Our approach is radically different: we do not set out to provide for a symmetrical basis for all legal contracts, in fact, our system uses a devolved, that is to say, \" federated \", a model of interlocking networks, and consortiums and composability. Objectives (i) the promotion of certainty and predictability; (ii) the promotion of uniformity of application; (iii) the protection of democratic ideals and ensuring of jurisprudential deliberation, and; (iv) the retention of efficiency. Equivalence vs. Partial Equivalence We can determine that there lie two base units for the legal system through leximetric analysis, that is to say, there are units of obligatory execution and units of voluntary execution. This means that there are things you do on your own, and this that you do because you were coerced into doing or your agency has been impaired (e.g. imprisonment. We take these units (e.g. mechanisms for enforcement) and quantify them so that we may determine the necessary capabilities of specific EDI transaction Statement of Definitions transitive (the start of a chain of precedence relations must precede the end of the chain antisymmetric (no two different elements precede each other), reflexive (each element is comparable to itself) Equivalance Relation equivalence relation as defined mathematically; a = a (reflexive property) a = b then b = a a = b and b = c then a = c (transitive property) partial equivalence as defined mathematically aRb then bRa (symmetry) if aRb and bRc then aRc (transitivity) Classifying legal mechanisms in terms of mathematical properties A similar approach applied for automating security audits So these Properties listed above are the \" relations \" of classification upon which we then determine how the legal obligations are arranged, which will then determine what it can do and can not do in the protocol. This portion of the protocol is called the \" mapping engine \", and is one of the solutions that will enable global adoption, as it represents a legal parity, not a functionally equivalent contract. The Main Classifiers used in determining protocol capabilities are: Symmetry Transitivity Reflexive Additional Assessment Techniques of Realizing Legal Parity Leximetric Analysis When do drafters of legal instruments specify details and when do they not? (i) That statute length varies systematically across countries, partially controlling for substance; (ii) that other legal instruments, such as judicial opinions and contracts, are longer in countries with long statutes; (iii) that both of the above are correlated with a large lawyer population. System based design methodology in designing and understanding the legal implications of actions and which to give weight to. This list is basically a filter for determining which primitive is applicable to which law, i.e. this is part of the mapping engine we have developed. source Legal Patterns We use the term \" pattern \" meaning relevant to our protocol, and \" anti-pattern \" to represent a more subjective interpretation or one that is hard to automate to determine should it be included or not. Patterns Law that addresses a problem that has not been defined Law that addresses a problem that no longer exists Law that addresses more than one problem Law that has no stated purpose The language of the law is vague or complex Law is unable to achieve its stated goal Anti-Patterns Laws that address problems that have not been defined Laws that address problems that no longer exist Laws that address more than one problem in different domains Laws that lack a stated, measurable problem solving the goal, or purpose Laws that fail to achieve their goal or lack stated goals Laws that lack a citation of references Laws whose burdens are greater than their problem-solving benefit Laws whose problem-solving benefit and burdens are equal Laws whose results cannot be measured Laws that interfere with other laws Laws that duplicate other laws Requires Review Laws that are not enforced Laws that violate \"human rights\" Laws that are overly vague or complex Laws that have not undergone QA analysis within a specified time frame Now that we have established legal patterns and a legal classified, we can begin to map out how these relationships present themselves, either by acting upon, being acted upon, events, etc. Primitives Primitives Layer Primitives List of Legal Primitive Mechanisms: PrimitiveEvent ExercisePrimitive AllocationPrimitive ContractFormationPrimitive ExecutionPrimitive InceptionPrimitive ObservationPrimitive QuantityChangePrimitive ResetPrimitive TermsChangePrimitive TransferPrimitive ExecutionPrimitive Specification of the primitive event for execution, with ' after ' state being an ExecutionState and the ' before ' state being Null. The ' before ' ExecutionState (0\u20260) The 0 cardinality reflects the fact that there is no execution in the before the state of an execution primitive. Think of this as the \" genesis \" point. after ExecutionState The after state corresponds to the execution between the parties. In the case of execution on a contractual product, some additional characteristics may need to be specified to get a fully-formed contract, for instance when the executing party acts as an agent, as is the case in an allocation scenario. This is the purpose of the ContractFormation primitive event. ContractFormationPrimitive Note This design pattern is different in that it does not bundle together execution of the contract and formation of the contract, similar to the way a proxy contract works. The design pattern for this is to better provide for atomic primitives. Our purposes does not need such atomicity, as they are contractual products. ExecutionPrimitive + ContractFormationPrimitive = atomic financial primitive InceptionPrimitive = contractual product primitive Specification of the primitive event for the formation of a contract, with ' before ' state being an ' ExecutionState ' and ' after ' state being a ' PostInceptionState '. AllocationPrimitive The primitive event to represent a split/allocation of a trade. As part of this primitive event the type of trade, either execution or a contract, does not get altered. In the case of an execution, the further transformation of each split execution into a contract will be the purpose of the ContractFormation primitive. Primitive Example example workflow of a contractual product condition ContractType: if AllocationPrimitive exists and before \\-> execution exists then after \\-> originalTrade \\-> execution exists and after \\-> allocatedTrade \\-> execution exists and after \\-> allocatedTrade \\-> contract is absent condition ContractType: if AllocationPrimitive exists and before \\-> contract exists then after \\-> originalTrade \\-> contract exists and after \\-> allocatedTrade \\-> contract exists and after \\-> allocatedTrade \\-> execution is absent ```` `ExerciseTimingPrimitive` which is deemed as associated to a request for exercise that is meant to take place, as opposed to the actual exercise event. Similar to how in FpML an OptionExercise is constructed. `InceptionPrimitive` The primitive event for the inception of a new contract between parties. `ObservationPrimitive` A class to specify the primitive object to specify market observation events, which is applicable across all asset classes. `QuantityChangePrimitive` The primitive event represents a change in quantity or notional. `ResetPrimitive` The primitive event represents a reset. `TermsChangePrimitive` The primitive event represents change(s) to the contractual terms and the clearing submission and acceptance process. `TransferPrimitive` A class to specify the transfer of assets between parties, those assets being either cash, securities, or physical assets (such as freight or an asset held by a bailee relationship such as warehouse receipts). This class combines components that are cross-assets (settlement date, settlement type, status, ...) and some other which are specialized by asset class (e.g. the payer/receiver amount and cashflow type for a cash transfer, the transferor/transferee, security indication, quantity, and asset transfer type qualification for the case of security).

The effectiveness of any network or regime (Barrett 2003) is a function of three factors: The ambition of its provisions The level of participation between actors The degree to which actors comply with this framework In designing version 2 of the protocol we had to set forth some design criteria to be able to model not only user behavior but also to help in planning long term priorities in terms of what we should focus on so that we may realize this.

According to Phil Hu, Airbnb\u2019s figure is 1:70, Uber\u2019s is 1:50, and eBay\u2019s is 1:5. The more customers one provider can serve, the more you should focus on supply in the beginning. The math behind the reasoning is quite simple: when you are acquiring users by hand, acquiring a provider is more valuable than acquiring a customer since the provider will likely participate in more transactions. Another reason is that idle customers are more dangerous than idle providers.

Diffreent standards define the commonly used business transactions in a formal, structured manner called transaction sets. X12 standards differ from data exchange protocols, in that a protocol allows data to flow from one computer to another without regard to the structure or meaning of the exchange. Character sets EDI consists of text data, and the text is restricted to using specific ASCII characters. A basic character set is defined for all exchanges, and this set may be extended with additional characters by mutual agreement of the trading partners. The characters described here are in universal use today, and using any additional characters is discouraged if not prohibited. Basic characters Uppercase letters A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z Numeric digits 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Special characters ! \" & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; ? = The space character Control characters : BEL HT LF VT FF CR FS GS RS US NL ASCII hex values : 07 09 0 A 0 B 0 C 0 D 1 C 1 D 1 E 1 F Extended characters Lowercase letters a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z Other special chars % ~ @ [ ] _ { } \\ | < > National characters # $ Control characters : SOH STX ETX EOT ENQ ACK DC1 DC2 DC3 DC4 NAK SYN ETB ASCII hex values : 01 02 03 04 05 06 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Delimiters Symbols representing delimiters Symbol Type of delimiter Segment terminator Data element separator Component element separator Elements and higher structures of the EDI transaction sets are distinguished by delimiters . Three delimiter values may be used: two levels of separators, for elements and sub-elements, and a terminator which indicates the end of a data segment. Delimiters are specified in the header of each interchange and shall not be used within a data element value elsewhere in the exchange. Actual characters used as delimiters are set within each exchange. Standards documentation indicates the use of a delimiter with symbols as shown in the sidebar. EDI standards do not impose requirements on delimiter choices other than to prohibit the use of a delimiter within a data element. Recommended delimiters are shown in the following table, along with values suggested in the standards and values in common use in industry: Delimiter TradeDoc Standards suggest Industry practice <tr> Unix newline 0A hex, 10 dec any control char 1C hex preferred return/linefeed 0D0A hex, CR/LF <gs> Unix backtick (`) 60 hex, 96 dec special or control 1D hex preferred asterisk (*) tilde (~) <us> Unix carat (^) 5E hex, 94 dec special or control 1F hex preferred colon (:) EDI data is exchanged in different ways, but always comes down to encoding . Specifically the backtick and carat symbols are not included in the EDI character set, and therefore are not present in data elements. Please see our section on Codecs for more information on the subject. Data Elements The data element is the smallest named unit of information in the standard. Data elements are identified as either simple or component. A data element which occurs within a composite data structure is identified as a component data element. A data element which is outside the boundaries of a composite structure is a simple data element. The distinction between simple and component elements is based on the placement of the element in the set and not on the attributes of the element . Each data element is assigned a unique reference identifier of from one to four digits. Data elements have three attributes: the type, the length minimum, and the length maximum. Data element types are as follows: Type Code Data Element Type Description Numeric Nn Numeric value with a predefined implied decimal point Decimal R Numeric with an explicit decimal place Identifier ID A unique coded value from a predetermined list String AN A sequence of basic or extended characters Date DT A standard date in the format YYMMDD Time TM A time in the format HHMMSSd\u2026\u200bd Binary B Numeric sequence of binary octets Fixed String FS Space-padded sequence of basic or extended characters Composite Data Structures The composite data structure is an intermediate unit of information in a segment. The definition of a composite data structure consists of two or more component data elements. In the actual data transmission the composite may consist of one or more component data elements. Adjacent component elements in a composite data structure are delimited by the component element separator . Composite data structures are delimited from other adjacent elements in a segment by the data element separator . Each composite data structure has a unique four-character reference identifier. The identifiers for composite data structures which appear in control segments start with an S; a C is the first letter of composite identifiers which are used in data segments. A detail table defines the component data elements in a composite data structure . Each component referenced has a requirement and an ordinal sequence in the structure. In the actual data transmission omitted elements are indicated by including their delimiters to preserve this sequence, except for elements which are omitted at the end of the component data structure. 1.component 2. component data structure 3. composite data structure 4. delimiter 5. segments Data Segment Structures The data segment is an intermediate unit of related information in a transaction set. Simple data elements and composite data structures are the data parts of the segment. Each segment in a transmission starts with the segment identifier, followed by at least one data element or component structure, and ending with a segment terminator . Each data segment has a unique two- or three-character identifier which also serves as a label for the segment in the data transmission. Segment labels are separated from the following data element by an element separator . The label is considered to be position zero of the segment, so that the first data element following the label is in position one. A detail table defines the sequence of simple data elements and composite data structures in a segment. Each unit referenced has a requirement and an ordinal sequence in the segment. In the actual data transmission omitted elements are indicated by including their delimiters to preserve this sequence, except for elements which are omitted at the end of the segment. <!> Freight Trust Strictly Enforces which delimiters can be used Transaction Sets The transaction set is a complete unit of information exchanged between trading partners, representing a business document. Each transaction starts with a header segment (ST) and ends with a trailer segment (SE). At least one data segment is required between the header segment and the trailer. Each segment in the transaction set ends with the segment terminator . The transaction set identifier uniquely identifies each transaction set. This identifier is the first data element of the transaction set header segment. The transaction set header and trailer segments contain a control number which must be identical for any given transaction. Transaction set control numbers should not repeat in the history of exchanges of the transaction set between two trading partners. The transaction set trailer segment also contains a count of the number of segments in the transaction including the ST and SE segments. The sequence of data segments in a transaction set definition is presented in detail tables for the set. Up to three tables may be used to represent transaction header information, repeating details, and a summary area. Each segment in a set has a requirement designator, a position in the set definition, and a maximum occurrence. An example set detail table is shown below: NA Pos Seg Segment Name Req MaxUse Level Repeat Loop Repeating Single data segments within a transaction set may repeat up to a specified maximum number of occurrences, as shown in the MaxUse column. The notation >1 is used to show that the number of repeats for a segment is unlimited. Groups of two or more related data segments may be repeated as a loop. Loops may be either unbounded, or bounded by loop start `(LS)` and loop end `(LE)` segments. Unbounded loops The start of an unbounded loop is marked by the occurrence of the first segment of the loop. The beginning segment of an unbounded loop shall not appear anywhere else in a loop. The requirement for a loop is implicitly the requirement of the loop\u2019s first segment . Designators Requirement Segment Designator. If the requirement designator for the first segment of a loop is mandatory, then the loop must appear at least once in the transaction set`. A loop may be repeated up to a specified maximum number of times. The notation >1 designates an unlimited repeat. A level entry indicates the nesting of loops, and the start of a loop structure is indicated by a loop label on the first segment of the loop. When unbounded loops are nested within loops , the inner loop shall not start at the same position as any outer loop . The inner loop shall not start with the same segment identifier as the start of any outer loop, nor may the inner loop contain a segment that is also the beginning segment of any outer loop in the same structure. The inner loop must end before or on the same segment as its immediate outer loop. Bounded loops The characteristics of unbounded loops also apply to bounded loops, except that bounded loops have no restriction on which segment begins the loop. For bounded loops, a unique loop identifier defined in the standard is used in the LS and LE segments to convey segment position or loop hierarchy, or both, within the transaction set. Transmission Files A transmission consists of a sequence of interchanges in a stream which are all addressed to a specific trading partner (as when receiving) or all addressed from a specific partner (as when sending).

In fact, the consistency-latency tradeoff is potentially more significant than CAP, since it has a more direct effect of the baseline operations of modern distributed database systems. System Model and Components Network Components The Blockchain serves as a global log of configuration and meta information. Through the blockchain component, network participants can register their existence along with verifiable data of their activities (such as schemas they use (e.g. X12 4010), service levels they guarantee (e.g. Web Services Agreement Specification , or contract terms with other participants). These transaction could used as input to automated arbitration of disputes per the guidelines setout in the Network Rulebook . [[nodelet: sequence, schedule, storage]] \u2014 Node Layers The sequencing layer (or \u201csequencer\u201d) intercepts transactional inputs and places them into a global transactional input sequence\u2014this sequence will be the order of transactions to which all replicas will ensure serial equivalence during their execution. The sequencer therefore also handles the replication and logging of this input sequence. The scheduling layer (or \u201cscheduler\u201d) orchestrates transaction execution using a deterministic locking scheme to guarantee equivalence to the serial order specified by the sequencing layer while allowing transactions to be executed concurrently by a pool of transaction execution threads The storage layer handles all physical data layout. Sequencer and Replication [note]: epoch here does not mean the same as concensus epoch for validators 10-second epochs during which every machine\u2019s sequencer component collects transaction requests from clients. At the end of each epoch, all requests that have arrived at a sequencer node are compiled into a batch. This is the point at which replication of transactional inputs occurs. Checkpointing Deterministic database systems have two properties that simplify the task of ensuring fault tolerance. First, active replication allows clients to instantaneously failover to another replica in the event of a crash. Second, only the transactional input is logged\u2014there is no need to pay the overhead of physical REDO logging. Replaying history of transactional input is sufficient to recover the database system to the current state. However, it would be inefficient to replay the entire history of the database from the beginning of time upon every failure.

As the inifial live applicafion of the Roseta DSL, examples from the ISDA CDM will be used to illustrate each of those features. Data Component The Roseta DSL provides four data de\ufb01nifion components that are used to model data, grouped into two pairs: Type and Atribute Enumerafion and Enumerafion Value Type and Attribute Purpose A type describes an enfity (also somefimes referred to as an object or a class ) in the model and is de\ufb01ned by a plain-text descripfion and a set of atributes . Atributes specify the granular elements composing the enfity. Syntax The de\ufb01nifion of a type starts with the keyword , followed by the type name. A colon punctuafion introduces the rest of the de\ufb01nifion. The \ufb01rst component of the de\ufb01nifion is a plain-text descripfion of the type. Descripfions use quotafion marks (to mark a string) in between angle brackets Descripfions, although not generafing any executable code, are integral meta-data components of the model. As modelling best pracfice, a de\ufb01nifion ought to exist for every artefact and be clear and comprehensive. Then the de\ufb01nifion of the type lists its component atributes. Each atribute is de\ufb01ned by four components, syntacfically ordered as: name type cardinality: see Cardinality Secfion descripfion \uf06a Note The Roseta DSL does not use any delimiter to end de\ufb01nifions. All model de\ufb01nifions start with a similar opening keyword as , so the start of a new de\ufb01nifion marks the end of the previous one. For readability more generally, the Roseta DSL looks to eliminate all the delimiters that are ohen used in tradifional programming languages (such as curly braces or semi-colon ). Each atribute can be speci\ufb01ed either as a basic type, a type or an enumerafion. The set of basic types available in the Roseta DSL are controlled at the language level by the de\ufb01nifion: Text - Number - Logic - (for integer) and (for \ufb02oat) Date and Time - , and The Roseta DSL convenfion is that type names use the PascalCase (starfing with a capital leter, also referred to as the upper CamelCase ), while atribute names use the camelCase (starfing with a lower case leter, also referred to as the lower camelCase). Type names need to be unique across the model. All those requirements are controlled by the Roseta DSL grammar. Time For fime zone adjustments, a fime zone quali\ufb01er can be speci\ufb01ed alongside a fime in one of two ways: Through the basic type, which needs to be expressed either as UTC or as an o\ufb00set to UTC, as speci\ufb01ed by the ISO 8601 standard. Through the type, where fime is speci\ufb01ed alongside a business center. This is used to specify a fime dimension in relafion to a future event: e.g. the earliest or latest exercise fime of an opfion. While there has been discussion as to whether the Roseta DSL should support dates which are speci\ufb01ed as an o\ufb00set to UTC with the su\ufb03x, no posifive conclusion has been reached. The main reason is that all dates which need a business date context can already specify an associated business center. Inheritance The Roseta DSL supports an inheritance mechanism , when a type inherits its de\ufb01nifion and behaviour (and therefore all of its atributes) from another type and adds its own set of atributes on top. Inheritance is supported by the keyword next to the type name. \uf06a Note For clarity purposes, the documentafion snippets omit the synonyms and de\ufb01nifions that are associated with the classes and atributes, unless the purpose of the snippet is to highlight some of those features. Enumeration and Enumeration Value Purpose Enumerafion is the mechanism through which an atribute may only take some speci\ufb01c controlled values . An enumerafion is the container for the corresponding set of controlled (or enumerafion) values. This mimics the scheme concept, whose values may be speci\ufb01ed as part of an exisfing standard and can be represented through an enumerafion in the Roseta DSL. Typically, a scheme with no de\ufb01ned values is represented as a basic type. Syntax Enumerafions are very simple modelling containers, which are de\ufb01ned in the same way as other model components. The de\ufb01nifion of an enumerafion starts with the keyword, followed by the enumerafion name. A colon punctuafion introduces the rest of the de\ufb01nifion, which contains a plain-text descripfion of the enumerafion and the list of enumerafion values. Enumerafion names must be unique across a model. The Roseta DSL naming convenfion is the same as for types and must use the upper CamelCase (PascalCase). In addifion the enumerafion name should end with the su\ufb03x Enum. Enumerafion values have a restricted syntax to facilitate their integrafion with executable code: they cannot start with a numerical digit, and the only special character that can be associated with them is the underscore . In order to handle the integrafion of scheme values which can have special characters, the Roseta DSL allows to associate a display name to any enumerafion value. For those enumerafion values, special characters are replaced with while the entry corresponds to the actual value. An example is the day count fracfion scheme for interest rate calculafion, which includes values such as to the and and These are associated as enumerafion values, respecfively. Annotation Component Annotation De\ufb01nition Purpose Annotafions allow to associate meta-informafion to model components, which can serve a number of purposes: purely syntacfic, to provide addifional guidance when navigafing model components to add constraints to a model that may be enforced by syntax validafion to modify the actual behaviour of a model in generated code Examples of annotafions and their usage for di\ufb00erent purposes are illustrated below. Syntax Annotafions are de\ufb01ned in the same way as other model components. The de\ufb01nifion of an annotafion starts with the keyword, followed by the annotafion name. A colon punctuafion introduces the rest of the de\ufb01nifion, starfing with a plain-text descripfion of the annotafion. Annotafion names must be unique across a model. The Roseta DSL naming convenfion is to use a (lower) camelCase. It is possible to associate atributes to an annotafion (see example), even though some annotafions may not require any further atribute. For instance: Meta-Data and Reference Purpose The and atributes. annotafion allows to associate a set of meta-data quali\ufb01ers to types Each atribute of the annotafion corresponds to a quali\ufb01er: The meta-data quali\ufb01er indicates a type that is referenceable, so that a unique idenfi\ufb01er can be associated to objects of that type. This allows to replicates the cross-referencing mechanism used in XML to provide data integrity within the context of an instance document. The replicates the meta- data as used in the FpML standard, which associates a cross-reference value to the object\u2019s data source. The types. meta-data quali\ufb01er provides the same funcfionality as but for basic The meta-data quali\ufb01er indicates that the atribute may be speci\ufb01ed as a reference, using the of a referenceable object as meta-data. This replicates the (for hyper-text reference ) meta-data as used in the FpML standard, where the cross-reference value may be speci\ufb01ed as meta-informafion in the atribute\u2019s data source. The meta-data quali\ufb01er speci\ufb01es a mechanism to control the set of values that an atribute can take. The relevant scheme reference may be speci\ufb01ed as meta-informafion in the atribute\u2019s data source, so that no originafing informafion is disregarded. The corresponds to a hash code to be generated by the model implementafion. The implementafion provided in the Roseta DSL is the de-facto Java hash funcfion. It is a deep hash that uses the complete set of atribute values that compose the type and its atributes, recursively. \uf06a Note Some annotafions, such as this metadata quali\ufb01cafion, may be provided as standard as part of the Roseta DSL itself. Addifional annotafions can always be de\ufb01ned for any model. Syntax Once an annotafion is de\ufb01ned, its name and chosen atribute, if any, are used in between square brackets to annotate model components. The below and types illustrate how meta-data annotafions and their relevant atributes can be used in a model: A the quali\ufb01er is associated to the type, the atribute of type type, which means it is referenceable. In quali\ufb01er, which is associated to the , indicates that this atribute can be provided as a reference (via its associated key) instead of a copy. An example implementafion of this cross-referencing mechanism for these types can be found in the Synonym Secfion of the documentafion. Partial Key Meta-data keys that are generated by a hashing algorithm from an object\u2019s atribute values ohen \ufb01nd a pracfical use by implementors for reconciling and matching data, where equality between hash values is considered a proxy for a data match. In some cases, it is necessary to remove some of an object\u2019s atribute values from the hashing algorithm, when those values are not required in the reconciliafion but risk adding noise in the hash that could generate false negafives. This is typically the case for meta-data quali\ufb01ers (such as meta-data keys), which may themselves be automafically generated by an algorithm. These may result in di\ufb00erences between two objects, even if those objects would have the same actual values. An implementafion of such parfial key used to be provided as a feature of the Roseta DSL (with a annotafion). It has now been de-commissioned, unfil further evaluafion of its usage emerges that may lead to a redesign of this feature. Quali\ufb01ed Type The Roseta DSL provides for some special types called quali\ufb01ed types , which are speci\ufb01c to its applicafion in the \ufb01nancial domain: Calculafion - Object quali\ufb01cafion - Those special types are designed to \ufb02ag atributes which result from running some logic, such that model implementafions can idenfify where to stamp the output in the model. The logic is being captured by speci\ufb01c types of funcfions that are detailed in the Funcfion De\ufb01nifion Secfion. Calculation The quali\ufb01ed type, when speci\ufb01ed instead of the type for the atribute, represents the outcome of a calculafion. An example usage is the conversion from clean price to dirty price for a bond. An atribute with the tagged with the funcfion output. type is meant to be associated to a funcfion annotafion. The atribute\u2019s type is implied by the Object Quali\ufb01cation Similarly, and represent the outcome of quali\ufb01cafion logic to infer the type of an object (\ufb01nancial product or event) in the model. See the atribute, alongside other idenfi\ufb01er atributes in the type: Atributes of these types are meant to be associated to an object quali\ufb01cafion funcfion tagged with the annotafion. The annotafion has an atribute to specify which type of object (like or ) is being quali\ufb01ed. \uf06a Note The quali\ufb01ed type feature in the Roseta DSL is under evaluafion and may be replaced by a mechanism that is purely based on these funcfion annotafions in the future. Data Validation Component Data integrity is supported by validafion components that are associated to each data type in the Roseta DSL. There are two types of validafion components: Cardinality Condifion Statement The validafion components associated to a data type generate executable code designed to be executed on objects of that type. Implementors of the model can use the code generated from these validafion components to build diagnosfic tools that can scan objects and report on which validafion rules were safis\ufb01ed or broken. Typically, the validafion code is included as part of any process that creates an object, to verify its validity from the point of creafion. Cardinality Cardinality is a data integrity mechanism to control how many of each atribute an object of a given type can contain. The Roseta DSL borrows from XML and speci\ufb01es cardinality as a lower and upper bound in between braces. The lower and upper bounds can both be any integer number. A 0 lower bound means atribute is opfional. A upper bound means an unbounded atribute. represents that there must be one and only one atribute of this type. When the upper bound is greater than 1, the atribute will be considered as a list, to be handled as such in any generated code. A separate validafion rule is generated for each atribute\u2019s cardinality constraint, so that any cardinality breach can be associated back to the speci\ufb01c atribute and not just to the object overall. Condition Statement Purpose Condifions are logic statements associated to a data type. They are predicates on atributes of objects of that type that evaluate to True or False. Syntax Condifion statements are included in the de\ufb01nifion of the type that they are associated to and are usually appended aher the de\ufb01nifion of the type\u2019s atributes. The de\ufb01nifion of a condifion starts with the keyword, followed by the name of the condifion and a colon punctuafion. The condifion\u2019s name must be unique in the context of the type that it applies to (but does not need to be unique across all data types of a given model). The rest of the condifion de\ufb01nifion comprises: a plain-text descripfion (opfional) a logic expression that applies to the the type\u2019s atributes The Roseta DSL o\ufb00ers a restricted set of language features designed to be unambiguous and understandable by domain experts who are not sohware engineers, while minimising unintenfional behaviour. The Roseta DSL is not a Turing-complete language: it does not support looping constructs that can fail (e.g. the loop never ends), nor does it nafively support concurrency or I/O operafions. The language features that are available in the Roseta DSL to express validafion condifions emulate the basic boolean logic available in usual programming languages: condifional statements: , , boolean operators: , list statements: , , , comparison operators: , , , , , \uf06a Note Condifions are included in the de\ufb01nifion of the data type that they are associated to, so they are \u201caware\u201d of the context of that data type. This is why atributes of that data type can be directly used to express the validafion logic, without the need to refer to the type itself. Special Syntax Some speci\ufb01c language features have been introduced in the Roseta DSL, to handle validafion cases where the basic boolean logic components would create unecessarily verbose, and therefore less readable, expressions. Those use-cases were deemed frequent enough to jusfify developing a speci\ufb01c syntax for them. Choice Choice rules de\ufb01ne a choice constraint between the set of atributes of a type in the Roseta DSL. They allow a simple and robust construct to translate the XML xsd:choicesyntax , although their usage is not limited to those XML use cases. The choice constraint can be either: opfional , represented by the atributes needs to be present, or required , represented by the atributes needs to be present syntax, when at most one of the syntax, when exactly one of the While most of the choice rules have two atributes, there is no limit to the number of atributes associated with it, within the limit of the number of atributes associated with the type. \uf06a Note Members of a choice rule need to have their lower cardinality set to 0, something which is enforced by a validafion rule. One-of (as complement to choice rule) In the case where all the atributes of a given type are subject to a required choice logic that results in one and only one of them being present in any instance of that type, the Roseta DSL allows to associate a condifion to the type, as short- hand to by-pass the implementafion of the corresponding choice rule. This feature is illustrated below: Only Exists The component is an adaptafion of the simple syntax, that veri\ufb01es that the atribute exists but also that no other atribute of the type does. This syntax drasfically reduces the condifion expression, which would otherwise require to combine one with mulfiple (applied to all other atributes). It also makes the logic more robust to future model changes, where newly introduced atributes would need to be tested for . \uf06a Note This condifion is typically applied to atribues of objects whose type implements a condifion. In this case, the quali\ufb01er is redundant with the condifion because only one of the atributes can exist. However, makes the condifion expression more explicit, and also robust to potenfial lihing of the condifion. Function Component In programming languages, a funcfion is a \ufb01xed set of logical instrucfions returning an output which can be parameterised by a set of inputs (also known as arguments ). A funcfion is invoked by specifying a set of values for the inputs and running the instrucfions accordingly. In the Roseta DSL, this type of component has been uni\ufb01ed under a single funcfion construct. Funcfions are a fundamental building block to automate processes, because the same set of instrucfions can be executed as many fimes as required by varying the inputs to generate a di\ufb00erent, yet determinisfic, result. Just like a spreadsheet allows users to de\ufb01ne and make use of funcfions to construct complex logic, the Roseta DSL allows to model complex processes from reusable funcfion components. Typically, complex processes are de\ufb01ned by combining simpler sub-processes, where one process\u2019s output can feed as input into another process. Each of those processes and sub-processes are represented by a funcfion. Funcfions can invoke other funcfions, so they can represent processes made up of sub- processes, sub-sub-processes, and so on. Reusing small, modular processes has the following bene\ufb01ts: Consistency . When a sub-process changes, all processes that use the sub- process bene\ufb01t from that single change. Flexibility . A model can represent any process by reusing exisfing sub-processes. There is no need to de\ufb01ne each process explicitly: instead, we pick and choose from a set of pre-exisfing building blocks. Where widely adopted industry processes already exist, they should be reused and not rede\ufb01ned. Some examples include: Mathemafical funcfions. Funcfions such as sum, absolute, and average are widely understood, so do not need to be rede\ufb01ned in the model. Reference data. The process of looking-up through reference data is usually provided by exisfing industry ufilifies and a model should look to re-use it but not re-implement it. Quanfitafive \ufb01nance. Many quanfitafive \ufb01nance solufions, some open-source, already de\ufb01nes granular processes such as: compufing a coupon schedule from a set of parameters adjusfing dates given a holiday calendar This concept of combining and reusing small components is also consistent with a modular component approach to modelling. Function Speci\ufb01cation Purpose Funcfion speci\ufb01cafion components are used to de\ufb01ne the processes applicable to a domain model in the Roseta DSL. A funcfion speci\ufb01cafion de\ufb01nes the funcfion\u2019s inputs and/or output through their types (or enumerafions ) in the data model. This amounts to specifying the API that implementors should conform to when building the funcfion that supports the corresponding process. Standardising those APIs guarantees the integrity, inter-operability and consistency of the automated processes supported by the domain model. Syntax Funcfions are de\ufb01ned in the same way as other model components. The syntax of a funcfion speci\ufb01cafion starts with the keyword followed by the funcfion name. A colon punctuafion introduces the rest of the de\ufb01nifion. The Roseta DSL convenfion for a funcfion name is to use a PascalCase (upper CamelCase ) word. The funcfion name needs to be unique across all types of funcfions in a model and validafion logic is in place to enforce this. The rest of the funcfion speci\ufb01cafion supports the following components: plain-text decripfions inputs and output atributes (the later is mandatory) condifion statements on inputs and output output construcfion statements Descriptions The role of a funcfion must be clear for implementors of the model to build applicafions that provide such funcfionality. To beter communicate the intent and use of funcfions, Roseta supports mulfiple plain-text descripfions in funcfions. Descripfions can be provided for the funcfion itself, for any input and output and for any statement block. Look for occurences of text descripfions in the snippets below. Inputs and Output Inputs and output are a funcfion\u2019s equivalent of a type\u2019s atributes. As in a , each atribute is de\ufb01ned by a name, data type (as either a , or ) and cardinality. At minimum, a funcfion must specify its output atribute, using the keyword also followed by a colon . Most funcfions, however, also require inputs, which are also expressed as atributes, using the keyword. is plural whereas is singular, because a funcfion may only return one type of output but may take several types of inputs. Conditions A funcfion\u2019s inputs and output can be constrained using condifions . Each condifion is expressed as a logical statement that evaluates to True or False, using the same language features as those available to express condifion statements in data types and detailed in the Condifion Statement Secfion. Condifion statements in a funcfion can represent either: a pre-condifion , using the keyword, applicable to inputs only and evaluated prior to execufing the funcfion, or a post-condifion , using the keyword, applicable to inputs and output and evaluated aher execufing the funcfion (once the output is known) Condifions are an essenfial feature of the de\ufb01nifion of a funcfion. By constraining the inputs and output, they de\ufb01ne the constraints that impementors of this funcfion must safisfy, so that it can be safely used for its intended purpose as part of a process. func EquityPriceObservation: < \"Function specification for the observation of an equity price, based on the attributes of the 'EquityValuation' class.\"> inputs: equity Equity (1..1) valuationDate AdjustableOrRelativeDate (1..1) valuationTime BusinessCenterTime (0..1) timeType TimeTypeEnum (0..1) determinationMethod DeterminationMethodEnum (1..1) output: observation ObservationPrimitive (1..1) condition: < \"Optional choice between directly passing a time or a timeType, which has to be resolved into a time based on the determination method.\"> if valuationTime exists then timeType is absent else if timeType exists then valuationTime is absent else False post-condition: < \"The date and time must be properly resolved as attributes on the output.\"> observation \u2192 date = ResolveAdjustableDate(valuationDate) and if valuationTime exists then observation \u2192 time = TimeZoneFromBusinessCenterTime(valuationTime) else observation \u2192 time = ResolveTimeZoneFromTimeType(timeType, determinationMethod) post-condition: < \"The number recorded in the observation must match the number fetched from the source.\"> observation \u2192 observation = EquitySpot(equity, observation \u2192 date, observation \u2192 time) \uf06a Note The funcfion syntax intenfionally mimics the type syntax in the Roseta DSL regarding the use of descripfions, atributes (inputs and output) and condifions, to provide consistency in the expression of model de\ufb01nifions. Function De\ufb01nition The Roseta DSL allows to further de\ufb01ne the business logic of a funcfion , by building the funcfion output instead of just specifying the funcfion\u2019s API. The creafion of valid output objects can be fully or parfially de\ufb01ned as part of a funcfion speci\ufb01cafion, or completely leh to the implementor. A funcfion is fully de\ufb01ned when all validafion constraints on the output object have been safis\ufb01ed as part of the funcfion speci\ufb01cafion. In this case, the generated code is directly usable in an implementafion. A funcfion is parfially de\ufb01ned when the output object\u2019s validafion constraints are only parfially safis\ufb01ed. In this case, implementors will need to extend the generated code and assign the remaining values on the output object. A funcfion must be applied to a speci\ufb01c use case in order to determine whether it is fully de\ufb01ned or parfially de\ufb01ned . There are a number of fully de\ufb01ned funcfion cases explained in further detail below. The Roseta DSL only provides a limited set of language features. To build the complete processing logic for a parfially de\ufb01ned funcfion, model implementors are meant to extend the code generated from the Roseta DSL once it is expressed in a fully featured programming language. For instance in Java, a funcfion speci\ufb01cafion generates an interface that needs to be extended to be executable. The output object will be systemafically validated when invoking a funcfion, so all funcfions require the output object to be fully valid as part of any model implementafion. Output Construction In the example above, the statements assert whether the observafion\u2019s date and value are correctly populated according to the output of other, sub-funcfions, but delegates the construcfion of that output to implementors of the funcfion. In pracfice, implementors of the funcfion can be expected to re-use those sub- funcfions ( and ) to construct the output. The drawback is that those sub-funcfions are likely to be executed twice: once to build the output and once to run the validafion. For e\ufb03ciency, the funcfion syntax in the Roseta DSL allows to directly build the output by assigning its values. Funcfion implementors do not have to build those values themselves, because the funcfion already provides them by default, so the corresponding post-condifions are redundant and can be removed. The example above could be rewriten as follows: The Roseta DSL also supports a number of fully de\ufb01ned funcfion cases , where the output is being built up to a valid state: Object quali\ufb01cafion Calculafion Short-hand funcfion Those funcfions are typically associated to an annotafion, as described in the Quali\ufb01ed Type Secfion, to instruct code generators to create concrete funcfions. Object Quali\ufb01cation Function The Roseta DSL supports the quali\ufb01cafion of \ufb01nancial objects from their underlying components according to a given classi\ufb01cafion taxonomy, in order to support a composable model for those objects (e.g. \ufb01nancial products, legal agreements or their associated lifecycle events). Object quali\ufb01cafion funcfions evaluate a combinafion of asserfions that uniquely characterise an input object according to a chosen classi\ufb01cafion. Each funcfion is associated to a quali\ufb01cafion name (a from that classi\ufb01cafion) and returns a boolean. This boolean evaluates to True when the input safis\ufb01es all the criteria to be idenfi\ufb01ed according to that quali\ufb01cafion name. Object quali\ufb01cafion funcfions are associated to a annotafion that speci\ufb01es the type of object being quali\ufb01ed. The funcfion name start with the pre\ufb01x, followed by an underscore upper CamelCase (PascalCase) word, using The naming convenfion is to have an to append granular quali\ufb01cafion names where the classi\ufb01cafion may use other types of separators (like space or colon ). Syntax validafion logic based on the this. annotafion is in place to enforce Calculation Function Calculafion funcfions de\ufb01ne a calculafion output that is ohen, though not exclusively, of type They must end with an statement that fully de\ufb01nes the calculafion result. Calculafion funcfions are associated to the annotafion. Alias The funcfion syntax supports the de\ufb01nifion of aliases that are only available in the context of the funcfion. Aliases work like temporary variable assignments used in programming languages and are parficularly useful in fully de\ufb01ned funcfions.

Short-Hand Function Short-hand funcfions are funcfions which are designed to provide a compact syntax for operafions that need to be frequently invoked in the model - for instance, model indirecfions when the corresponding model expression may be deemed too long or cumbersome: which could be invoked as part of mulfiple other funcfions that use the object by simply stafing: Mapping Component Synonym Purpose Synonym is the baseline building block to map a model expressed in the Roseta DSL to alternafive data representafions, whether those are open standards or proprietary. Synonyms can be complemented by mapping logic when the relafionship is not a one-to-one or is condifional. Synonyms are speci\ufb01ed at the atribute level for a data type. Synonyms can also be associated to enumerafions and are speci\ufb01ed at the enumerafion value level. Mappings are typically implemented by traversing the model tree down, so knowledge of the context of an atribute (i.e. the type in which it is used) determines what it should map to. Knowledge about the upper-level type would be lost if synonyms were implemented at the class level. There is no limit to the number of synonyms that can be associated to any atribute, and there can even be several synonyms for a given data source (e.g. in the case of a condifional mapping). Syntax Synonyms are introduced by the atribute in between square brackets synonym syntax has two components: keyword and are speci\ufb01ed for each , same as an annotafion. The baseline source , which possible values are controlled by a special enumerafion type of value , which is a the source For example for a data type: that idenfi\ufb01es the name of the atribute as it is found in Or an enumerafion: enum NaturalPersonRoleEnum: < \"The enumerated values for the natural person\u2019s role.\"> Broker < \"The person who arranged with a client to execute the trade.\"> [synonym FpML_5_10 , CME_SubmissionIRS_1_0 , CME_ClearedConfirm_1_17 value \"Broker\"] Buyer < \"Acquirer of the legal title to the financial instrument.\"> [synonym FpML_5_10, CME_SubmissionIRS_1_0, CME_ClearedConfirm_1_17 value \"Buyer\"] DecisionMaker < \"The party or person with legal responsibility for authorization of the execution of the transaction.\"> synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"DecisionMaker\" synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"DecisionMaker\" ExecutionWithinFirm < \"Person within the firm who is responsible for execution of the transaction.\"> synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"ExecutionWithinFirm\" synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"ExecutionWithinFirm\" InvestmentDecisionMaker < \"Person who is responsible for making the investment decision.\"> synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"InvestmentDecisionMaker\" synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"InvestmentDecisionMaker\" Seller < \"Seller of the legal title to the financial instrument.\"> [synonym FpML_5_10, CME_SubmissionIRS_1_0, CME_ClearedConfirm_1_17 value \"Seller\"] Trader < \"The person who executed the trade.\"> synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"Trader\" synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"Trader\" \uf06a Note The synonym value is of type to facilitate integrafion with executable code. The alternafive approach consisfing of specifying the value as a compafible idenfi\ufb01er alongside a display name has been disregarded because it has been deemed not appropriate to create a \u201ccode-friendly\u201d value for the respecfive synonyms. A further set of atributes can be associated with a synonym, to address speci\ufb01c use cases: path to allow mapping when data is nested in mulfiple levels within the respecfive model. hint to allow mapping when data is nested in di\ufb00erent ways between the respecfive models.

Meta-Data Mapping When meta-data are associated to an atribute, as decribed in the Meta-Data and Reference Secfion, addifional synonym syntax allows to specify how to retrieve the corresponding meta-data from the source. This is illustrated by the usage of the synonym syntax in the example below: The atribute has an associated The scheme can be retrieved using the source. meta-data that is atached to the value in the synonym To be able to specify an atribute as a reference from an exisfing source, the source itself must implement some cross-referencing mechanism so that the reference can be idenfi\ufb01ed, as in the works as follows: / mechanism used in XML. The cross-referencing the atribute must specify the idenfi\ufb01er value for the reference in the synonym source. For the meta-data of the atribute above, this is speci\ufb01ed as the value in the source. an idenfi\ufb01er value must be associated to the object being referenced. For the type, this is speci\ufb01ed as the shown below: meta-data in the synonym source, as The below JSON extract illustrates an implementafion of these meta-data in the context of a transacfion event , which idenfi\ufb01es the parfies to the transacfions as well as the issuer of the event (i.e. who submits the transacfion message). There are two parfies to the event, associated with idenfi\ufb01ers as \u201cparty1\u201d and \u201cparty2\u201d. Their actual are speci\ufb01ed through an FpML values are \u201cParty 1\u201d and \u201cParty 2\u201d, which referred to in meta-data. Roseta also associates an internal meta-data. hash to each party, as implementafion of the Thanks to the quali\ufb01er, the atribute can simply reference the event issuer party as \u201cParty 2\u201d rather than duplicafing its components. The cross-reference is sourced from the original FpML document using the implemented synonym. The internal points to the hash while the points to the \u201cparty2\u201d , as sourced from the original FpML document. Also note that the itself has an associated meta-data by default since its class has a quali\ufb01er. \uf06a Note This example is not part of the Roseta DSL but corresponds to the default JSON implementafion of the model. The choice of either maintaining or shredding external references (such as \u201cparty2\u201d), once cross-reference has been established using the source document, is up to implementors of the model. Mapping Rule Purpose There are cases where the mapping between exisfing standards and protocols and their relafion to the model is not one-to-one or is condifional. Synonyms have been complemented with a syntax to express mapping logic that provides a balance between \ufb02exibility and legibility. Syntax The mapping rule syntax di\ufb00ers from the normal Roseta DSL syntax in that it is not expressed as a stand-alone block with a quali\ufb01er pre\ufb01x such as . Instead, the mapping rule is posifioned as an extension of the synonym syntax. Several mapping rule expressions can be associated with a given synonym. A mapping rule is composed of two (opfional) expressions: mapping value pre\ufb01xed with , which speci\ufb01es the value that the atribute should be set to when the condifional expression is true condifional expression pre\ufb01xed with mapping value , to associate condifional logic to the The mapping logic associated with the party role example below provides a good illustrafion of such logic:","title":"Output"},{"location":"concepts/output/#_1","text":"Docs \u00bb The Roseta DSL documentafion \u00bb Roseta Modelling Components Rosetta Modelling Components The Roseta syntax can express \ufb01ve types of model components : Data Annotafion Data Validafion (or condifion ) Funcfion Mapping (or synonym ) This documentafion details the purpose and features of each type of model component and highlights the relafionships that exist among those.

Funcfions are a fundamental building block to automate processes, because the same set of instrucfions can be executed as many fimes as required by varying the inputs to generate a di\ufb00erent, yet determinisfic, result. Just like a spreadsheet allows users to de\ufb01ne and make use of funcfions to construct complex logic, the Roseta DSL allows to model complex processes from reusable funcfion components. Typically, complex processes are de\ufb01ned by combining simpler sub-processes, where one process\u2019s output can feed as input into another process. Each of those processes and sub-processes are represented by a funcfion. Funcfions can invoke other funcfions, so they can represent processes made up of sub- processes, sub-sub-processes, and so on. Reusing small, modular processes has the following bene\ufb01ts: Consistency . When a sub-process changes, all processes that use the sub- process bene\ufb01t from that single change. Flexibility . A model can represent any process by reusing exisfing sub-processes. There is no need to de\ufb01ne each process explicitly: instead, we pick and choose from a set of pre-exisfing building blocks. Where widely adopted industry processes already exist, they should be reused and not rede\ufb01ned. Some examples include: Mathemafical funcfions. Funcfions such as sum, absolute, and average are widely understood, so do not need to be rede\ufb01ned in the model. Reference data. The process of looking-up through reference data is usually provided by exisfing industry ufilifies and a model should look to re-use it but not re-implement it. Quanfitafive \ufb01nance. Many quanfitafive \ufb01nance solufions, some open-source, already de\ufb01nes granular processes such as: compufing a coupon schedule from a set of parameters adjusfing dates given a holiday calendar This concept of combining and reusing small components is also consistent with a modular component approach to modelling.","title":"Function Component"},{"location":"concepts/output/#function-speci\ufb01cation","text":"","title":"Function Speci\ufb01cation"},{"location":"concepts/output/#purpose_5","text":"Funcfion speci\ufb01cafion components are used to de\ufb01ne the processes applicable to a domain model in the Roseta DSL.

First, the JVM implementation could be enhanced to completely address this issue. Particularly, if the GC logging activities are separated from the critical JVM GC processes that cause STW pauses, then this problem will go away. For instance, JVM can put the GC logging function into a different thread which handles the log file writing independently, hence not contributing to the STW pauses. Taking the separate-thread approach however risks losing last GC log information during JVM crash. It might make sense to expose a JVM flag allowing users to specify their preference. Since the extent of STW pauses caused by background IO depends on how heavy the latter is, various ways to reduce the background IO intensity can be applied. For instance, de-allocating other IO-intensive applications on the same node, reducing other types of logging, improving on the log rotation, etc. For latency-sensitive applications such as online ones serving interactive users, large STW pauses (e.g., >0.25 seconds) are intolerable. Hence, special treatments need to be applied. The bottom line of ensuring no big STW pauses induced by OS is to avoid GC logging being blocked by OS IO activities.

If the buffers are too small, the TCP congestion window will never fully open up. If the receiver buffers are too large, TCP flow control breaks and the sender can overrun the receiver, which will cause the TCP window to shut down. This is likely to happen if the sending host is faster than the receiving host. The optimal buffer size is twice the bandwidth*delay product of the link: buffer size = 2 * bandwidth * delay For example, if your ping time is 50 ms, and the end-to-end network consists of all 1G or 10G Ethernet, the TCP buffers should be: .05 sec * (1 Gbit / 8 bits) = 6.25 MBytes.

This is due to the extra work the SSD controller must do to find available space, rewrite existing data, and erase unused space so that it can be rewritten. This process of garbage collection results in internal write amplification to the SSD, expressed as the ratio of SSD write operations to user write operations. This decrease in performance is even larger if the write operations are not in multiples of 4,096 bytes or not aligned to a 4,096-byte boundary. If you write a smaller amount of bytes or bytes that are not aligned, the SSD controller must read the surrounding data and store the result in a new location. This pattern results in significantly increased write amplification, increased latency, and dramatically reduced I/O performance. source, aws.

First, the JVM implementation could be enhanced to completely address this issue. Particularly, if the GC logging activities are separated from the critical JVM GC processes that cause STW pauses, then this problem will go away. For instance, JVM can put the GC logging function into a different thread which handles the log file writing independently, hence not contributing to the STW pauses. Taking the separate-thread approach however risks losing last GC log information during JVM crash. It might make sense to expose a JVM flag allowing users to specify their preference. Since the extent of STW pauses caused by background IO depends on how heavy the latter is, various ways to reduce the background IO intensity can be applied. For instance, de-allocating other IO-intensive applications on the same node, reducing other types of logging, improving on the log rotation, etc. For latency-sensitive applications such as online ones serving interactive users, large STW pauses (e.g., >0.25 seconds) are intolerable. Hence, special treatments need to be applied. The bottom line of ensuring no big STW pauses induced by OS is to avoid GC logging being blocked by OS IO activities.

Glossary Demeaning Behavior is acting in a way that reduces another person\u2019s dignity, sense of self-worth or respect within the community. Discrimination is the prejudicial treatment of an individual based on criteria such as: physical appearance, race, ethnic origin, genetic differences, national or social origin, name, religion, gender, sexual orientation, family or health situation, pregnancy, disability, age, education, wealth, domicile, political view, morals, employment, or union activity. Insulting Behavior is treating another person with scorn or disrespect. Acknowledgement is a record of the origin(s) and author(s) of a contribution. Harassment is any conduct, verbal or physical, that has the intent or effect of interfering with an individual, or that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment. Leadership Position includes group Chairs, project maintainers, staff members, node operators, network operators, and Board members. Participant includes the following persons: Developers Node Operators Network Operators Member representatives Staff members Anyone from the Public partaking in the Freight Trust work environment (e.g. contribute code, comment on our code or specs, email us, attend our conferences, functions, etc) Respect is the genuine consideration you have for someone (if only because of their status as participant in Freight Trust, like yourself), and that you show by treating them in a polite and kind way. Sexual Harassment includes visual displays of degrading sexual images, sexually suggestive conduct, offensive remarks of a sexual nature, requests for sexual favors, unwelcome physical contact, and sexual assault. Unwelcome Behavior Hard to define? Some questions to ask yourself are: how would I feel if I were in the position of the recipient? would my spouse, parent, child, sibling or friend like to be treated this way? would I like an account of my behavior published in the organization\u2019s newsletter? could my behavior offend or hurt other members of the work group? could someone misinterpret my behavior as intentionally harmful or harassing? would I treat my boss or a person I admire at work like that ? Summary: if you are unsure whether something might be welcome or unwelcome, don\u2019t do it. Unwelcome Sexual Advance includes requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, where: submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual\u2019s employment, submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as a basis for employment decisions affecting the individual, such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual\u2019s work performance or creating an intimidating hostile or offensive working environment. Workplace Bullying is a tendency of individuals or groups to use persistent aggressive or unreasonable behavior (e.g. verbal or written abuse, offensive conduct or any interference which undermines or impedes work) against a co-worker or any professional relations.

Federal [and state] law require[s] Freight Trust to retain certain records, usually for a specific amount of time. The accidental or intentional destruction of these records during their specified retention periods could result in the following consequences for Freight Trust and/or its employees: Fines and penalties. Loss of rights. Obstruction of justice charges. Inference of spoliation of evidence and spoliation tort claims. Contempt of court charges Serious disadvantages in litigation. Freight Trust must retain certain records because they contain information that: Serves as Freight Trust\u2019s corporate memory. Has enduring business value (for example, it provides a record of a business transaction, evidences Freight Trust\u2019s rights or obligations, protects Freight Trust\u2019s legal interests or ensures operational continuity). Must be kept to satisfy legal, accounting, or other regulatory requirements. Freight Trust prohibits the inappropriate destruction of any records, files, documents, samples, and other forms of information. This policy is in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, under which it is a crime to change, conceal, falsify, or destroy any record with the intent to impede or obstruct any official or government proceeding. Therefore, this policy is part of a company-wide system for the review, retention, and destruction of records Freight Trust creates or receives in connection with the business it conducts. REASONS FOR POLICY Counsel may consider revising the clause above to include mention of any state or local law for the jurisdiction(s) where this policy will be used. Also consider adding examples of records that are specific to the company\u2019s industry and workplace. Types of Documents This policy explains the differences among records, disposable information, and confidential information belonging to others. Records A record is any type of information created, received, or transmitted in the transaction of Freight Trust\u2019s business, regardless of physical format. Examples of where the various types of information are located include: Appointment books and calendars. Audio and video recordings. Computer programs. Contracts. Electronic files. Emails. Handwritten notes. Invoices. Letters and other correspondence. Magnetic tape. Memory in cell phones and PDAs. Online postings, such as on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Medium, Slack, Github and other social media platforms and websites. Performance reviews. Test samples. Voicemails. Therefore, any paper records and electronic files, including any records of donations made online, that are part of any of the categories listed in the Records Retention Schedule contained in the Appendix to this policy, must be retained for the amount of time indicated in the Records Retention Schedule. A record must not be retained beyond the period indicated in the Record Retention Schedule, unless a valid business reason (or a litigation hold or other special situation) calls for its continued retention. If you are unsure whether to retain a certain record, contact the Records Management Officer or the Legal Department. Disposable Information Disposable information consists of data that may be discarded or deleted at the discretion of the user once it has served its temporary useful purpose and/or data that may be safely destroyed because it is not a record as defined by this policy. Examples may include: image Duplicates of originals that have not been annotated. Preliminary drafts of letters, memoranda, reports, worksheets, and informal notes that do not represent significant steps or decisions in the preparation of an official record. Books, periodicals, manuals, training binders, and other printed materials obtained from sources outside of Freight Trust and retained primarily for reference purposes. Spam and junk mail. Confidential Information Belonging to Others Any confidential information that an employee may have obtained from a source outside of Freight Trust, such as a previous employer, must not, so long as such information remains confidential, be disclosed to or used by Freight Trust. Unsolicited confidential information submitted to Freight Trust should be refused, returned to the sender where possible, and deleted, if received via the internet. Mandatory Compliance Responsibility of All Employees Freight Trust strives to comply with the laws, rules, and regulations that govern it and with recognized compliance practices. All company employees must comply with this policy, the Records Retention Schedule and any litigation hold communications. Failure to do so may subject Freight Trust, its employees, and contract staff to serious civil and/or criminal liability. An employee\u2019s failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary sanctions, including suspension or termination. Reporting Policy Violations Freight Trust is committed to enforcing this policy as it applies to all forms of records. The effectiveness of Freight Trust\u2019s efforts, however, depends largely on employees.

If you are not comfortable bringing the matter up with your immediate supervisor, or do not believe the supervisor has dealt with the matter properly, you should raise the matter with the [Records Management Officer/manager at the next level above your direct supervisor]. If employees do not report inappropriate conduct, Freight Trust may not become aware of a possible violation of this policy and may not be able to take appropriate corrective action. No one will be subject to and Freight Trust prohibits, any form of discipline, reprisal, intimidation, or retaliation for reporting incidents of inappropriate conduct of any kind, pursuing any record destruction claim, or cooperating in related investigations. MANDATORY COMPLIANCE It is important to remind all employees that retaliation of any kind, including for reporting any type of violation of a policy, is strictly prohibited.

How to Store and Destroy Records Storage Freight Trust\u2019s records must be stored in a safe, secure, and accessible manner. Any documents and financial files that are essential to Freight Trust\u2019s business operations during an emergency must be duplicated and/or backed up at least once per week and maintained off site. STORAGE This clause reminds employees to back up files necessary for the company\u2019s business continuation procedures. Counsel should consider revising the clause to include any records protected by state or local law for the jurisdiction(s) where this policy will be used. Also consider indicating the off-site location where duplicate files must be sent if physical copies are to be stored in a separate location, such as a storage facility. Destruction Freight Trust\u2019s [Records Management Officer/OTHER OFFICER/MANAGER] is responsible for the continuing process of identifying the records that have met their required retention period and supervising their destruction. The destruction of confidential, financial, and personnel-related records must be conducted by shredding if possible. Non-confidential records may be destroyed by recycling. The destruction of electronic records must be coordinated with the IT Department [TITLE]. The destruction of records must stop immediately upon notification from [the Legal Department] that a litigation hold is to begin because Freight Trust may be involved in a lawsuit or an official investigation (see next paragraph). Destruction may begin again once the Legal Department lifts the relevant litigation hold. Destruction The dcument management program and training procedures include instructions on how the Records Management Officer and other employees should destroy records. Once an employee destroys a record, he should document its destruction with the Records Management Officer, the Legal Department and other relevant personnel. The destruction of electronic records should be coordinated with the IT department to ensure that all copies of the electronic records are discarded, including copies residing on backup tapes, temporary files, additional servers, and all employees' email in-boxes and other electronic storage locations. Litigation Holds and Other Special Situations Freight Trust requires all employees to comply fully with its published records retention schedule and procedures as provided in this policy. All employees should note the following general exception to any stated destruction schedule: If you believe, or [the Legal Department] informs you, that Freight Trust records are relevant to current litigation, potential litigation (that is, a dispute that could result in litigation), government investigation, audit, or other event, you must preserve and not delete, dispose, destroy, or change those records, including emails, until [the Legal Department] determines those records are no longer needed. This exception is referred to as a litigation hold or legal hold, replaces any previously or subsequently established destruction schedule for those records. If you believe this exception may apply, or have any questions regarding whether it may possibly apply, please contact [the Legal Department].","title":"Document Retention Policy"},{"location":"corporate/document-retention-policy/#_1","text":"Freight Trust Records Management Officer","title":""},{"location":"corporate/document-retention-policy/#overivew","text":"The corporate information of Freight Trust [and its subsidiaries] is important to how it conducts business and manages employees.

Freight Trust must retain certain records because they contain information that: Serves as Freight Trust\u2019s corporate memory. Has enduring business value (for example, it provides a record of a business transaction, evidences Freight Trust\u2019s rights or obligations, protects Freight Trust\u2019s legal interests or ensures operational continuity). Must be kept to satisfy legal, accounting, or other regulatory requirements. Freight Trust prohibits the inappropriate destruction of any records, files, documents, samples, and other forms of information. This policy is in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, under which it is a crime to change, conceal, falsify, or destroy any record with the intent to impede or obstruct any official or government proceeding.

Operations Group Operations Group determines the nature of the attack (this might be different than the initial assessment suggests). Determine the attack point of origin. Determine the intent of the attack. Was the attack specifically directed at your organization to acquire specific information, or was it random? Identify the systems that have been compromised. Identify the files that have been accessed and determine the sensitivity of those files. Determine whether unauthorized hardware has been attached to the network or whether there are any signs of unauthorized access through the compromise of physical security controls. Examine key groups (domain administrators, administrators, and so on) for unauthorized entries. Search for security assessment or exploitation software. Cracking utilities are often found on compromised systems during evidence gathering. Look for unauthorized processes or applications currently running or set to run using the startup folders or registry entries. Search for gaps in, or the absence of, system logs. Review intrusion detection system logs for signs of intrusion, which systems might have been affected, methods of attack, time and length of attack, and the overall extent of potential damage. Examine other log files for unusual connections; security audit failures; unusual security audit successes; failed logon attempts; attempts to log on to default accounts; activity during nonworking hours; file, directory, and share permission changes; and elevated or changed user permissions. Compare systems to previously conducted file/system integrity checks. This enables you to identify additions, deletions, modifications, and permission and control modifications to the file system and registry. You can save a lot of time when responding to incidents if you identify exactly what has been compromised and what areas need to be recovered. Search for sensitive data, such as credit card numbers and employee or customer data, that might have been moved or hidden for future retrieval or modifications. You might also have to check systems for non-business data, illegal copies of software, and e-mail or other records that might assist in an investigation.

This can be difficult, because some essential responses might alert attackers. Compare the cost of taking the compromised and related systems offline against the risk of continuing operations. In the vast majority of cases, you should immediately take the system off the network. However, you might have service agreements in place that require keeping systems available even with the possibility of further damage occurring. Under these circumstances, you can choose to keep a system online with limited connectivity in order to gather additional evidence during an ongoing attack. In some cases, the damage and scope of an incident might be so extensive that you might have to take action that invokes the penalty clauses specified in your service level agreements. In any case, it is very important that the actions that you will take in the event of an incident are discussed in advance and outlined in this response plan so that immediate action can be taken when an attack occurs.

original source to this at TPC Pricing, 2.5.0 Specification Precedence [1.1] If there is a conflict between the Benchmark Standard and the Pricing Specification, the Pricing Specification is the controlling document. [1.2] If there is a conflict that is not explicitly called out in the Benchmark Standard, the pricing specification wording prevails. [1.3] If there is language in the pricing specification and not in the Benchmark Standard, the pricing specification prevails. [1.4] If there is language in the Benchmark Standard and not in the pricing specification, the Benchmark Standard prevails. General Guidelines The purpose of our benchmarks is to provide relevant, objective information to industry users. To achieve that purpose and to adhere to TPC benchmark standards, we require that Pricing: 1) Is no lower than what would be quoted to any Customer from the date of publication of the FDR until the Result ceases to be an Active Result. 2) Is actively used by the vendor in the market segment that the Pricing Conventions or represents (e.g., small business customers, or large corporations, depending on the type of system being priced). 3) A significant number of Customers in the market segment that the Pricing Conventions or represents would plausibly receive in a Purchase Agreement. Relevent Terms (not exhaustive) [Archive Operation Requirement] - The period of time for which data generated by the Priced Configuration as required by the benchmark specification must be maintained in on-line storage. [Response Time for Problem Recognition] - The period of time it takes from Customer request until an active process is underway to classify the problem and, if it is at a level that would qualify as a Failure in this document, initiate the isolation and eventual resolution of the problem. There must be ownership of the problem. Simply having it in a queue is not sufficient. Direct interaction with the Customer or their computer must underway. The resumption of Customer operations need not be guaranteed within the response period. [Failure] - A condition that prevents the system under test from performing benchmark operations at the performance and functional levels required by the Benchmark Standard and claimed in the FDR. [Field Replaceable Unit (FRU)] - A Component of the Priced Configuration that must be removed and/or installed by personnel of the maintenance provider. Fix - Any resolution (including \u201cworkarounds\u201d) that restores the Customer\u2019s Application to normal operation. [Priced Configuration]- The Line Items to be priced as defined in the Benchmark Standard. [Priced Currency] \u2013 A currency that a Customer commonly uses in the Priced Locale. The Priced Currency must be identified by an ISO Currency Code. [NOTE] The intent is the Priced Currency is one commonly used in the Priced Locale. [Priced Locale] \u2013 The geographical area where the entire Priced Configuration, including all Line Items and associated maintenance, are Generally Available in the Priced Currency(s) and from the documented Pricing Sources. [Pricing] - The methods and documentation used to obtain a Total Price for the Priced Configuration [Pricing Convention] - The algorithm or process used by a vendor to set or compute prices.

For example, if the Sales Channel is a web-based tool that automatically generated a price quotation, then the Pricing Source is that tool. [Pricing Spreadsheet] - The Pricing Spreadsheet is a table that lists the individually priced Line Items of the Priced Configuration, including the Pricing Source of the price, quantities, the computation of extended price, maintenance, and any applied Discounts. Pricing Methodology 1.1 Pricing Methodology The intent of this section is to define the methodology to be used to calculate the price and the price/performance Result of the Benchmark Standard. 1.2 Comparability The different Pricing Methodologies are not comparable. A Benchmark Standard may specify one and only one Pricing Methodology. 1.3 General Pricing Methodology Requirements The following requirements are applicable to all Pricing Methodologies. 1.3.1 The price listed must be the full price a Customer would pay for new Physically Acquired hardware or the acquisition of Licensed Compute Services, and new software licenses. Any other acquisition models are not allowed. 1.3.2 Pricing must be for a one-time, stand-alone purchase. Pricing cannot be based upon the acquisition or licensing from past, present, or future Customer purchases. 1.3.3 The Pricing must reflect the price for the acquisition of the system under test, the licensing of software used in the benchmark, and if applicable the contracts for maintenance. 1.3.4 The prices must be disclosed in a Line Item fashion using a Priced Currency of a Priced Locale where the Priced Configuration is Generally Available. 1.3.5 The Pricing for both the Physically Acquired hardware or the acquisition of Licensed Compute Services is based upon the Priced Configuration. 1.3.6 All Pricing must be good at the time of publication. Price changes are subject to rules for revision as stated in Clause 5.6. 1.3.7 The Line Items to be priced are defined in the Benchmark Standard as the Priced Configuration and if applicable, the maintenance on those Line Items. 1.3.8 The performance of the Measured Configuration and the Priced Configuration must be equivalent. 1.3.9 All hardware or Licensed Compute Services, software and support used in the calculations must be Orderable by any Customer on the Availability Date. 1.3.10 A Non-Disclosure Agreement or other restriction that prevents any Customer from ordering any priced Line Item disclosed in an FDR is not allowed. Comment: The presence of an NDA does not mean that obtaining the Pricing is exclusionary. The actual NDA needs to be examined to determine exclusionary pricing. For instance, there are types of NDA\u2019s in an End-User Licensing Agreement (EULA) which prevent end users from disclosing certain things learned about a product. 1.3.11 Local Pricing and Discount structures must be Available in each Priced Locale for which the Results are published. ===== 1.3.12 For Line Items, or associated maintenance, that are priced using a Non-Local Currency, a price quote must be provided by the Pricing Source, regardless if the Pricing Source is the Sponsor or a Third Party. ===== 1.3.13 If one or more Line Items are priced using a Priced Currency that is different from the Primary Currency, Currency Conversion must be applied to these Line Items. If more than one Line Item uses the same Priced Currency, Currency Conversion must be applied to the total amount of all Line Items using that Priced Currency, rather than to the price of each of those Line Items or to a sub-total amount of a subset of those Line Items. 1.3.14 Currency Conversions Results using Currency Conversion must do the following: \u2022 All Discounts must be applied prior to any Currency Conversion \u2022 The Discount must be in the same Priced Currency as the Line Item(s) \u2022 The Sponsor must use the same Currency Conversion Source for all Currency Conversions \u2022 Currency Conversion must be done no earlier than twenty-one (21) days prior to the Result submission \u2022 All Currency Conversions must be done no earlier than the latest price quote date \u2022 All Currency Conversions must occur on the same date \u2022 The date of the Currency Conversion must be disclosed in the Full Disclosure Report","title":"Pricing Benchmark"},{"location":"corporate/pricing-benchmark/#_1","text":"This is a partialy compliant TPC Pricing Standard Specification version 2.5.0 You can find the original source to this at TPC Pricing, 2.5.0","title":""},{"location":"corporate/pricing-benchmark/#specification-precedence","text":"[1.1] If there is a conflict between the Benchmark Standard and the Pricing Specification, the Pricing Specification is the controlling document.

Status : One of proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc. Evaluation criteria : Summary: explain briefly what we seek to discover and why. Specifics Candidates to consider : Summary: explain briefly how we discovered candidates, and draw attention to any outliers. List all candidates and related options; what are we evaluating as potential solutions? Specifics Research and analysis of each candidate : Summary: explain briefly the research methods, and draw attention to patterns, clusters, and outliers. Does/doesn\u2019t meet criteria and why Summary Specifics Cost analysis Summary Examples Licensing, such as contract agreements and legal commitments Training, such as upskilling and change management Operating, such as support and maintenance Metering, such as bandwidth and CPU usage SWOT analysis Summary Strengths Weaknesses Opportunites Threats Internal opinions and feedback Summary Examples By the team, ideally written by the actual person From other stakeholders Quality attributes a.k.a. cross-functional requirements External opinions and feedback Summary Who is providing the opinion? What are other candidates you considered? What are you creating? Examples B2B or B2C external-facing or employee-only desktop or mobile pilot or production monolith or microservices How did you evaluate the candidates? Why did you choose the winner? What is happening since then? Examples How is the winner performing? What % of real-world production user traffic is flowing through the winner? What kinds of integrations are involved, such as with continuous delivery pipelines, content management systems, analytics and metrics, etc.? Knowing what you know now, what would you advise people to do differently?

The status of the requirement (draft, reviewed, committed, etc.) Owner: The person responsible for implementing the requirement Author: The person that wrote the requirement Revision: A version number for the statement Date: The date of the most recent revision Assumptions: Anything that could cause problems if untrue now or later Risks: Anything that could cause malfunction, delay, or other negative impacts Defined: The definition of a term (better to use a glossary) Last updated 2020-06-23 21:25:23 -0700","title":"Adr plain"},{"location":"papers/adr/","text":"/* Asciidoctor default

description template published in \"Architecture Decisions: Demystifying Architecture\" by Jeff Tyree and Art Akerman, Capital One Financial . Issue Describe the architectural design issue you\u2019re addressing, leaving no questions about why you\u2019re addressing this issue now. Following a minimalist approach, address and document only the issues that need addressing at various points in the life cycle. Decision Clearly state the architecture\u2019s direction\u2014\u200bthat is, the position you\u2019ve selected. Status The decision\u2019s status, such as pending, decided, or approved. Group You can use a simple grouping\u2014\u200bsuch as integration, presentation, data, and so on\u2014\u200bto help organize the set of decisions. You could also use a more sophisticated architecture ontology, such as John Kyaruzi and Jan van Katwijk\u2019s, which includes more abstract categories such as event, calendar, and location. For example, using this ontology, you\u2019d group decisions that deal with occurrences where the system requires information under event. Assumptions Clearly describe the underlying assumptions in the environment in which you\u2019re making the decision\u2014\u200bcost, schedule, technology, and so on. Note that environmental constraints (such as accepted technology standards, enterprise architecture, commonly employed patterns, and so on) might limit the alternatives you consider. Constraints Capture any additional constraints to the environment that the chosen alternative (the decision) might pose. Positions List the positions (viable options or alternatives) you considered. These often require long explanations, sometimes even models and diagrams. This isn\u2019t an exhaustive list. However, you don\u2019t want to hear the question \"Did you think about\u2026\u200b?\" during a final review; this leads to loss of credibility and questioning of other architectural decisions. This section also helps ensure that you heard others\u2019 opinions; explicitly stating other opinions helps enroll their advocates in your decision. Argument Outline why you selected a position, including items such as implementation cost, total ownership cost, time to market, and required development resources\u2019 availability. This is probably as important as the decision itself. Implications A decision comes with many implications, as the REMAP metamodel denotes. For example, a decision might introduce a need to make other decisions, create new requirements, or modify existing requirements; pose additional constraints to the environment; require renegotiating scope or schedule with customers; or require additional staff training. Clearly understanding and stating your decision\u2019s implications can be very effective in gaining buy-in and creating a roadmap for architecture execution. Related decisions It\u2019s obvious that many decisions are related; you can list them here. However, we\u2019ve found that in practice, a traceability matrix, decision trees, or metamodels are more useful. Metamodels are useful for showing complex relationships diagrammatically (such as Rose models). Related requirements Decisions should be business driven. To show accountability, explicitly map your decisions to the objectives or requirements. You can enumerate these related requirements here, but we\u2019ve found it more convenient to reference a traceability matrix. You can assess each architecture decision\u2019s contribution to meeting each requirement, and then assess how well the requirement is met across all decisions. If a decision doesn\u2019t contribute to meeting a requirement, don\u2019t make that decision. Related artifacts List the related architecture, design, or scope documents that this decision impacts. Related principles If the enterprise has an agreed-upon set of principles, make sure the decision is consistent with one or more of them. This helps ensure alignment along domains or systems. Notes Because the decision-making process can take weeks, we\u2019ve found it useful to capture notes and issues that the team discusses during the socialization process.

IncoTerms + UCC + UNICALDRIOT To a lawyer, a legal contract has a distinct meaning: A contract is an agreement giving rise to obligations which are enforced or recognised by law. The factor which distinguishes contractual from other legal obligations is that they are based on the agreement of the contracting parties7. For a contract to be valid, legal systems will impose certain requirements. Under English law, there are four key elements that must (usually) be satisfied: (i) one of the contracting parties must make an offer to contract and the other(s) must accept that offer; (ii) there must be \u2018consideration\u2019 for the offer, this being some form of value that must be exchanged; (iii) the parties must have an intention to form legal relations; and (iv) there must be certainty as to terms of the contract.

Other systems of law may have other requirements \u2013 for example, under New York law, many legal contracts must be in writing and signed to become binding. - ISDA, \"Smart Contracts and Distributed Ledger \u2013 A Legal Perspective\" Other systems of law may have other requirements\u2009\u2014\u2009for example, under New York law, many legal contracts must be in writing and signed to become binding. Two Modes: National and International Contract Function Master Covenant RuleBook Agreement Master Participation Agreement Network Operator Agreement Transactional Clauses Amendment Clauses Business Terms and Conditions Intergration Clause National excludes lex mercatoria Clause < #> \u2013 Choice of law: lex mercatoria and Unidroit Principles This contract is governed by general principles of law generally recognized in international trade (lex mercatoria) together with the Unidroit Principles of International Commercial Contracts (except for Articles 2.20, 3.2.7 and 6.2.1).

Contract provisions, 2. general principles of law applicable to the particular type of contract in question, 3. trade usages, 4. Unidroit Principles.

encapsulation. For transmission of sensitive data, it is essential that appropriate security services, such as authentication, privacy and/or non-repudiation be provided. The Secure Transmission Loop In the \"secure transmission loop\" for EDI/EC, one organization sends a signed and encrypted EDI/EC interchange to another organization and requests a signed receipt, and later the receiving organization sends this signed receipt back to the sending organization. In other words, the following transpires: o The organization sending EDI/EC data signs and encrypts the data using S/MIME. In addition, the message will request that a signed receipt be returned to the sender. To support NRR, the original sender retains records of the message, message-ID, and digest (MIC) value. o The receiving organization decrypts the message and verifies the signature, resulting in verified integrity of the data and authenticity of the sender. o The receiving organization then returns a signed receipt using the HTTP reply body or a separate HTTP POST operation to the sending organization in the form of a signed message disposition notification. This signed receipt will contain the hash of the received message, allowing the original sender to have evidence that the received message was authenticated and/or decrypted properly by the receiver. Definition of Receipts The term used for both the functional activity and the message for acknowledging delivery of an EDI/EC interchange is \"receipt\" or \"signed receipt\". The first term is used if the acknowledgment is for an interchange resulting in a receipt that is NOT signed. The second term is used if the acknowledgement is for an interchange resulting in a receipt that IS signed. === NRR refers to a legal event that occurs only when the original sender of an interchange has verified the signed receipt coming back from recipient of the message, and has verified that the returned MIC value inside the MDN matches the previously recorded value for the original message === The term non-repudiation of receipt (NRR) is often used in combination with receipts. NRR refers to a legal event that occurs only when the original sender of an interchange has verified the signed receipt coming back from recipient of the message, and has verified that the returned MIC value inside the MDN matches the previously recorded value for the original message. NRR is best established when both the original message and the receipt make use of digital signatures. See the Security Considerations section for some cautions regarding NRR.

The network is unsecure Topology does change There are multiple administrators Transport cost is non-zero The network is heterogeneous Network Terms We define the term High Availability in the common colloquial sense found in the database community where a database is highly available if it can fail over to an active replica on the fly with no downtime, rather than the definition of high availability used in the CAP theorem which requires that even minority replicas remain available during a network partition. Data Integrity guarantees Not the Data Availability Gguarantees Network Axioms Data = Time Data = Immutable Time == Immutable Latency != Availability The structure of any system designed by an organization is isomorphic to the structure of the organization. When a settled system is disturbed, it will adjust to diminish the change that has been made to it. Any change in status quo prompts an opposing reaction in the responding system. Eight Fallacies of Distributed Computing The network is reliable Latency is zero Bandwidth is infinite The network is secure Topology doesn\u2019t change There is one administrator Transport cost is zero The network is homogeneous source for \"Eight Fallacies of Distributed Computing\" Last updated 2020-06-23 21:25:23 -0700","title":"Axioms"},{"location":"papers/central-dogma/","text":"/*

such a competitive sector will not only help but increase the rate of adoption going forward. Such an intricate problem that we are solving requires a careful appreciation for the intricate interplay of intercontinental trade. However, we can\u2019t let too many details cloud the path. This article describes more of the theory that we are applying in order to achieve something we call legal parity. As we have previously outlined, there are three sorts of smart contracts: functional equivalent parity Functional being that it posses an enforcement mechanism to induce behavior in a programmed mechanism, e.g. an escrow contract. Equivalent would be where your contractual rights are enforceable, such as a loan that defaults asserting your rights. Parity would mean that it does the exact behavior of actual legal contracts, in that it also involves 3 rd parties into the process, e.g. insurance companies. Now that we have the terminology to be able to express the legaliness, we can move onto the network itself. First, let\u2019s define what an effective network is, as that is our ultimate goal: none of this will be useful if the network itself is not an effective regime. The effectiveness of any network or regime (Barrett 2003) is a function of three factors: The ambition of its provisions The level of participation between actors The degree to which actors comply with this framework In designing version 2 of the protocol we had to set forth some design criteria to be able to model not only user behavior but also to help in planning long term priorities in terms of what we should focus on so that we may realize this. Taking a mathematical approach to smart contract design is useful in this attempt as it provides us with criteria that we can and can not do. \u2026\u200bthat a rule constitutes a legal obligation and that compliance is therefore required rather > than merely optional .`\" (Hart 1994) Much is said about \u201cequivalence\u201d as it relates to the digitization of shipping documents. Such that the term \u2018functionally equivalent\u2019 is used in the literature (Goldby 2012) to imply a sort of symmetry to these issues of physicality and possession. Our approach is radically different: we do not set out to provide for a symmetrical basis for all legal contracts, in fact, our system uses a devolved, that is to say, \u201cfederated\u201d, a model of interlocking networks, and consortiums and a concept we call composability. Objectives (i) the promotion of certainty and predictability; (ii) the promotion of uniformity of application; (iii) the protection of democratic ideals and ensuring of jurisprudential deliberation, and; (iv) the retention of efficiency. Equivalence vs. Partial Equivalence We can determine that there lie two base units for the legal system through leximetric analysis, that is to say, there are units of obligatory execution and units of voluntary execution. This means that there are things you do on your own, and this that you do because you were coerced into doing or your agency has been impaired (e.g. imprisonment. We take these units (e.g. mechanisms for enforcement) and quantify them so that we may determine the necessary capabilities of specific EDI transaction Statement of Definitions transitive (the start of a chain of precedence relations must precede the end of the chain antisymmetric (no two different elements precede each other), reflexive (each element is comparable to itself) equivalence relation as defined mathematically; a = a (reflexive property) a = b then b = a a = b and b = c then a = c (transitive property) partial equivalence as defined mathematically aRb then bRa (symmetry) if aRb and bRc then aRc (transitivity) Classifying legal mechanisms in terms of mathematical properties A similar approach applied for automating security audits So these Properties listed above are the \u201crelations\u201d of classification upon which we then determine how the legal obligations are arranged, which will then determine what it can do and can not do in the protocol. This portion of the protocol is called the \u201cmapping engine\u201d, and is one of the solutions that will enable global adoption, as it represents a legal parity, not a functionally equivalent contract. The Main Classifiers used in determining protocol capabilities are: Symmetry Transitivity Reflexive Additional Assessment Techniques of Realizing Legal Parity Leximetric Analysis When do drafters of legal instruments specify details and when do they not? (i) That statute length varies systematically across countries, partially controlling for substance; (ii) that other legal instruments, such as judicial opinions and contracts, are longer in countries with long statutes; and (iii) that both of the above are correlated with a large lawyer population. https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=456520 Metholodigcal System based design methodology in designing and understanding the legal implications of actions and which to give weight to. This list is basically a filter for determining which primitive is applicable to which law, i.e. this is part of the mapping engine we have developed. Legal Patterns for finding important laws We use the term \u201cpattern\u201d meaning relevant to our protocol, and \u201canti-pattern\u201d to represent a more subjective interpretation or one that is hard to automate to determine should it be included or not. Patterns Law that addresses a problem that has not been defined Law that addresses a problem that no longer exists The law addresses more than one problem Law that has no stated purpose The language of the law is vague or complex Law is unable to achieve its stated goal Anti-Patterns Laws that address problems that have not been defined Laws that address problems that no longer exist Laws that address more than one problem in different domains Laws that lack a stated, measurable problem solving the goal, or purpose Laws that fail to achieve their goal or lack stated goals Laws that lack a citation of references Laws whose burdens are greater than their problem-solving benefit Laws whose problem-solving benefit and burdens are equal Laws whose results cannot be measured Laws that interfere with other laws Laws that duplicate other laws Requires Review Laws that are not enforced* Laws that violate human rights* Laws that are overly vague or complex* Laws that have not undergone QA analysis within a specified time frame Now that we have established legal patterns and a legal classified, we can begin to map out how these relationships present themselves, either by acting upon, being acted upon, events, etc. Primitives Layer Primitives List of Legal Primitive Mechanisms PrimitiveEvent ExercisePrimitive AllocationPrimitive ContractFormationPrimitive ExecutionPrimitive InceptionPrimitive ObservationPrimitive QuantityChangePrimitive ResetPrimitive TermsChangePrimitive TransferPrimitive ExecutionPrimitive Specification of the primitive event for execution, with \u2018after\u2019 state being an ExecutionState and the \u2018before\u2019 state being Null. The \u2018before\u2019 ExecutionState (0\u2026\u200b0) The 0 cardinality reflects the fact that there is no execution in the before the state of an execution primitive. Think of this as the \u201cgenesis\u201d point. after ExecutionState The after state corresponds to the execution between the parties. In the case of execution on a contractual product, some additional characteristics may need to be specified to get a fully-formed contract, for instance when the executing party acts as an agent, as is the case in an allocation scenario. This is the purpose of the ContractFormation primitive event. ContractFormationPrimitive @dev this design pattern is different in that it does not bundle together execution of the contract and formation of the contract, similar to the way a proxy contract works. The design pattern for this is to better provide for atomic primitives. Our purposes do not need such atomicity, as they are contractual products. ExecutionPrimitive + ContractFormationPrimitive = atomic financial primitive InceptionPrimitive = contractual product primitive [see jEDI contract below] Specification of the primitive event for the formation of a contract, with \u2018before\u2019 state being an \u2018ExecutionState\u2019 and \u2018after\u2019 state being a \u2018PostInceptionState\u2019. AllocationPrimitive The primitive event to represent a split/allocation of a trade. As part of this primitive event the type of trade, either execution or a contract, does not get altered. In the case of an execution, the further transformation of each split execution into a contract will be the purpose of the ContractFormation primitive. Primitive Example example workflow of a contractual product condition ContractType: if AllocationPrimitive exists and before -> execution exists then after -> originalTrade -> execution exists and after -> allocatedTrade -> execution exists and after -> allocatedTrade -> contract is absent condition ContractType: if AllocationPrimitive exists and before -> contract exists then after -> originalTrade -> contract exists and after -> allocatedTrade -> contract exists and after -> allocatedTrade -> execution is absent ExercisePrimitive exerciseTiming which is deemed as associated to a request for exercise that is meant to take place, as opposed to the actual exercise event. Similar to how in FpML an OptionExercise is constructed. FpML 5.5 Inception Primitive The primitive event for the inception of a new contract between parties. Observation Primitive A class to specify the primitive object to specify market observation events, which is applicable across all asset classes. Quantity Change Primitive The primitive event represents a change in quantity or notional. Reset Primitive The primitive event represents a reset. Terms Change Primitive The primitive event represents change(s) to the contractual terms and the clearing submission and acceptance process. Transfer Primitive A class to specify the transfer of assets between parties, those assets being either cash, securities, or physical assets (such as freight or an asset held by a bailee relationship such as warehouse receipts). This class combines components that are cross-assets (settlement date, settlement type, status, \u2026\u200b) and some other which are specialized by asset class (e.g. the payer/receiver amount and cashflow type for a cash transfer, the transferor/transferee, security indication, quantity, and asset transfer type qualification for the case of security). Workflow for Contractual Product (e.g. Forward Contracts) Example Workflow if WorkflowStep -> businessEvent -> primitives -> inception -> after -> contract only exists then WorkflowStep -> businessEvent -> primitives -> inception -> after -> contract else if WorkflowStep -> businessEvent -> primitives -> quantityChange -> after -> contract exists then WorkflowStep -> businessEvent -> primitives -> quantityChange -> after -> contract else WorkflowStep -> businessEvent -> primitives -> inception -> after -> contract as \"Contract\" Last updated 2020-06-28 02:52:42

such a competitive sector will not only help but increase the rate of adoption going forward. Such an intricate problem that we are solving requires a careful appreciation for the intricate interplay of intercontinental trade. However, we can\u2019t let too many details cloud the path. This article describes more of the theory that we are applying in order to achieve something we call legal parity. As we have previously outlined, there are three sorts of smart contracts: functional equivalent parity Functional being that it posses an enforcement mechanism to induce behavior in a programmed mechanism, e.g. an escrow contract. Equivalent would be where your contractual rights are enforceable, such as a loan that defaults asserting your rights. Parity would mean that it does the exact behavior of actual legal contracts, in that it also involves 3rd parties into the process, e.g. insurance companies. Now that we have the terminology to be able to express the legaliness, we can move onto the network itself. First, let\u2019s define what an effective network is, as that is our ultimate goal: none of this will be useful if the network itself is not an effective regime. The effectiveness of any network or regime (Barrett 2003) is a function of three factors: The ambition of its provisions The level of participation between actors The degree to which actors comply with this framework In designing version 2 of the protocol we had to set forth some design criteria to be able to model not only user behavior but also to help in planning long term priorities in terms of what we should focus on so that we may realize this. Taking a mathematical approach to smart contract design is useful in this attempt as it provides us with criteria that we can and can not do. \u2026\u200bthat a rule constitutes a legal obligation and that compliance is therefore required rather > than merely optional .`\" (Hart 1994) Much is said about \u201cequivalence\u201d as it relates to the digitization of shipping documents. Such that the term \u2018functionally equivalent\u2019 is used in the literature (Goldby 2012) to imply a sort of symmetry to these issues of physicality and possession. Our approach is radically different: we do not set out to provide for a symmetrical basis for all legal contracts, in fact, our system uses a devolved, that is to say, \u201cfederated\u201d, a model of interlocking networks, and consortiums and a concept we call composability. Objectives (i) the promotion of certainty and predictability; (ii) the promotion of uniformity of application; (iii) the protection of democratic ideals and ensuring of jurisprudential deliberation, and; (iv) the retention of efficiency. Equivalence vs. Partial Equivalence We can determine that there lie two base units for the legal system through leximetric analysis, that is to say, there are units of obligatory execution and units of voluntary execution. This means that there are things you do on your own, and this that you do because you were coerced into doing or your agency has been impaired (e.g. imprisonment. We take these units (e.g. mechanisms for enforcement) and quantify them so that we may determine the necessary capabilities of specific EDI transaction Statement of Definitions transitive (the start of a chain of precedence relations must precede the end of the chain antisymmetric (no two different elements precede each other), reflexive (each element is comparable to itself) equivalence relation as defined mathematically; a = a (reflexive property) a = b then b = a a = b and b = c then a = c (transitive property) partial equivalence as defined mathematically aRb then bRa (symmetry) if aRb and bRc then aRc (transitivity) Classifying legal mechanisms in terms of mathematical properties A similar approach applied for automating security audits So these Properties listed above are the \u201crelations\u201d of classification upon which we then determine how the legal obligations are arranged, which will then determine what it can do and can not do in the protocol. This portion of the protocol is called the \u201cmapping engine\u201d, and is one of the solutions that will enable global adoption, as it represents a legal parity, not a functionally equivalent contract. The Main Classifiers used in determining protocol capabilities are: Symmetry Transitivity Reflexive Additional Assessment Techniques of Realizing Legal Parity Leximetric Analysis When do drafters of legal instruments specify details and when do they not? (i) That statute length varies systematically across countries, partially controlling for substance; (ii) that other legal instruments, such as judicial opinions and contracts, are longer in countries with long statutes; and (iii) that both of the above are correlated with a large lawyer population. https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=456520 Metholodigcal System based design methodology in designing and understanding the legal implications of actions and which to give weight to. This list is basically a filter for determining which primitive is applicable to which law, i.e. this is part of the mapping engine we have developed. Legal Patterns for finding important laws We use the term \u201cpattern\u201d meaning relevant to our protocol, and \u201canti-pattern\u201d to represent a more subjective interpretation or one that is hard to automate to determine should it be included or not. Patterns Law that addresses a problem that has not been defined Law that addresses a problem that no longer exists The law addresses more than one problem Law that has no stated purpose The language of the law is vague or complex Law is unable to achieve its stated goal Anti-Patterns Laws that address problems that have not been defined Laws that address problems that no longer exist Laws that address more than one problem in different domains Laws that lack a stated, measurable problem solving the goal, or purpose Laws that fail to achieve their goal or lack stated goals Laws that lack a citation of references Laws whose burdens are greater than their problem-solving benefit Laws whose problem-solving benefit and burdens are equal Laws whose results cannot be measured Laws that interfere with other laws Laws that duplicate other laws Requires Review Laws that are not enforced* Laws that violate human rights* Laws that are overly vague or complex* Laws that have not undergone QA analysis within a specified time frame Now that we have established legal patterns and a legal classified, we can begin to map out how these relationships present themselves, either by acting upon, being acted upon, events, etc. Primitives Layer Primitives List of Legal Primitive Mechanisms PrimitiveEvent ExercisePrimitive AllocationPrimitive ContractFormationPrimitive ExecutionPrimitive InceptionPrimitive ObservationPrimitive QuantityChangePrimitive ResetPrimitive TermsChangePrimitive TransferPrimitive ExecutionPrimitive Specification of the primitive event for execution, with \u2018after\u2019 state being an ExecutionState and the \u2018before\u2019 state being Null. The \u2018before\u2019 ExecutionState (0\u2026\u200b0) The 0 cardinality reflects the fact that there is no execution in the before the state of an execution primitive. Think of this as the \u201cgenesis\u201d point. after ExecutionState The after state corresponds to the execution between the parties. In the case of execution on a contractual product, some additional characteristics may need to be specified to get a fully-formed contract, for instance when the executing party acts as an agent, as is the case in an allocation scenario. This is the purpose of the ContractFormation primitive event. ContractFormationPrimitive @dev this design pattern is different in that it does not bundle together execution of the contract and formation of the contract, similar to the way a proxy contract works. The design pattern for this is to better provide for atomic primitives. Our purposes do not need such atomicity, as they are contractual products. ExecutionPrimitive + ContractFormationPrimitive = atomic financial primitive InceptionPrimitive = contractual product primitive [see jEDI contract below] Specification of the primitive event for the formation of a contract, with \u2018before\u2019 state being an \u2018ExecutionState\u2019 and \u2018after\u2019 state being a \u2018PostInceptionState\u2019. AllocationPrimitive The primitive event to represent a split/allocation of a trade. As part of this primitive event the type of trade, either execution or a contract, does not get altered. In the case of an execution, the further transformation of each split execution into a contract will be the purpose of the ContractFormation primitive. Primitive Example example workflow of a contractual product condition ContractType: if AllocationPrimitive exists and before -> execution exists then after -> originalTrade -> execution exists and after -> allocatedTrade -> execution exists and after -> allocatedTrade -> contract is absent condition ContractType: if AllocationPrimitive exists and before -> contract exists then after -> originalTrade -> contract exists and after -> allocatedTrade -> contract exists and after -> allocatedTrade -> execution is absent ExercisePrimitive exerciseTiming which is deemed as associated to a request for exercise that is meant to take place, as opposed to the actual exercise event. Similar to how in FpML an OptionExercise is constructed. FpML 5.5 Inception Primitive The primitive event for the inception of a new contract between parties. Observation Primitive A class to specify the primitive object to specify market observation events, which is applicable across all asset classes. Quantity Change Primitive The primitive event represents a change in quantity or notional. Reset Primitive The primitive event represents a reset. Terms Change Primitive The primitive event represents change(s) to the contractual terms and the clearing submission and acceptance process. Transfer Primitive A class to specify the transfer of assets between parties, those assets being either cash, securities, or physical assets (such as freight or an asset held by a bailee relationship such as warehouse receipts). This class combines components that are cross-assets (settlement date, settlement type, status, \u2026\u200b) and some other which are specialized by asset class (e.g. the payer/receiver amount and cashflow type for a cash transfer, the transferor/transferee, security indication, quantity, and asset transfer type qualification for the case of security). Workflow for Contractual Product (e.g. Forward Contracts) Example Workflow if WorkflowStep -> businessEvent -> primitives -> inception -> after -> contract only exists then WorkflowStep -> businessEvent -> primitives -> inception -> after -> contract else if WorkflowStep -> businessEvent -> primitives -> quantityChange -> after -> contract exists then WorkflowStep -> businessEvent -> primitives -> quantityChange -> after -> contract else WorkflowStep -> businessEvent -> primitives -> inception -> after -> contract as \"Contract\" Last updated 2020-06-28 02:52:42

Optimizing Mechanisms and Economic Incentives In order to achieve ecosystem success, our planning and designing of the platform (i.e. the network proper), we have broadly defined a few key indicators and metrics to ensure and gauge success. Consider the following: Lower transaction cost to drive evolution in markets Look for fragmented markets as an opportunity to seek for efficiencies Pass on to the customer the savings introduced by efficiencies Innovate pricing thanks to marketplace mechanism and data build mechanisms that support suppliers of all size Invest in creating a mechanism that brings the best to the top (i.e. rate of failure) Invest in mechanisms for empowerment, augmenting workers potential Creating a so-called platform to access and leverage the potential of an ecosystem is increasingly recognized as the most powerful way to achieve market success: leveraging on ecosystems through platforms simply shown the ability to reach objectives that go beyond what could be possibly achieved by a traditional strategy operating in a controlled, internal, company-owned environment. A study from Deloitte and OpenMatters analyzed the evolution of business models in history and characterized them as follows: Four business models have been used in history Asset Builders: build, develop, and lease physical assets Service Providers: provide services to customers in the form of billable hours Technology Creators: develop and sell intellectual property Network Orchestrators: create a network of entities in which the participants interact and build a shared value creation process The study also pointed out that the business models of Network Orchestrators achieved notably better results than others and looked like an ultimate \u201cevolution\u201d On Market Strategy \u201cIf a market, or strategy within a market, calls for extreme coordination, the firm model (ed: the industrial firm model) will outperform the network (ed: the platform model). For instance, to create the perfect consumer experience for a smartphone Apple has integrated vertically backwards all the way to making its own chips. Conversely if motivation is of the essence the market model will outperform a network.\u201c \u2014 Networked model of business is an evolution of franchise Tim O\u2019Riley The importance of having a Shaping Strategy According to John Hagel of Deloitte Center for the Edge the most advanced and ambitious firms can now leverage on a new, \u201cexciting potential\u201d. This potential relies on the ability to completely transform how a marketplace operates and capture an incredible amount of value by doing so. On Strategy \u201cToday, there are a growing number of opportunities to restructure entire markets and industries by designing new platforms and offering powerful incentives to motivate third parties to participate on them. These are very effective because they mobilize investment by a broad range of other participants rather than requiring the shaper to put all its own money on the table.\u201d \u2014 Deloitte John Hagel As Hagel explains very well in this passage and in the related post, the nature of continuous transformation in technology and markets brings up enormous opportunities for \u201caware\u201d firms and teams. Those firms can now identify fragmented (or even not yet properly existing) markets and design powerful incentive strategies \u2014 embodied by a combination of a digital platform and elements of incentive design \u2014 that can help them leverage the potential of complex ecosystems of interaction between third parties. These third parties can gain incredible advantages and value by joining the ecosystem and therefore let platform owners (shapers) benefit from extracting a fraction of it. Ecosystems, therefore, enable the participation of large and small organizations (or individuals) in creating value at a scale beyond the possibilities of a single firm. In these ecosystems, participants co-create and interact in a way which would be impossible to manage in a traditional top down (industrial) manner. As a result of this massive collaboration effort and value creation, participants (including so-called customers) are bonded by a shared interest and purpose and they protect and contribute to the ecosystem as a \u201ccommons\u201d that enables them. Application > Platform > Ecosystem Actualizing Ecosystems by incentives design with Platforms and Tokens With ecosystem actualization, I\u2019m meaning the process that \u2014 once the potential for growth and thrivability is recognized in an ecosystem \u2014 brings it to fully flowing. Ecosystem actualization normally is a two-step process (to simplify) and has a dichotomous nature: before and after critical mass (sometimes related to network effect) is achieved. At this point is a good idea to refresh a few key points: ecosystem thrive if supported by well defined and well-executed platform strategies; a functioning platform strategy is a set of incentives (crypto-narratives), a set of channels & contexts for interaction (primitives) a set of enabling services to support continuous improvement & learning (enablers) Assessing Platform Success and KPIs Our platform strategy is determined by three factors: Connection: how easily others can plug into the platform to share and transact Gravity: how well the platform attracts participants, both producers and consumers Flow: how well the platform fosters the exchange and co-creation of value Five factors that may determine whether a platform commodifies labour or allows workers to differentiate and grow. \u2014 Pipes to Platforms This approach, we believe, in providing agency to truckers rather than the commodification of their labour, will be a key point of differentiation for us. The Toolbox creates connection by making it easy for others to plug into the platform. This infrastructure enables interactions between participants. For example, Apple provides developers with the OS and underlying code libraries. The Magnet creates pull that attracts participants to the platform with a kind of social gravity. For transaction platforms, both producers and consumers must be present to achieve critical mass. Apple needed to attract both developers and users. Similarly, eBay needed both buyers and sellers. Platform builders must pay attention to the design of incentives, reputation systems, and pricing models. They must also leverage social media to harness the network effect for rapid growth. The Matchmaker fosters the flow of value by making connections between producers and consumers. Data is at the heart of successful matchmaking, and distinguishes platforms from other business models. The Matchmaker captures rich data about the participants and leverages that data to facilitate connections between producers and consumers. For example, Google matches the supply and demand of online content, while marketplaces like eBay match buyers to relevant products. Toolbox: xEDI Protocol, SaaS Solution, Open API Magnet: Incentives (e.g. rebates), bundling (e.g. SaaS free, only EDI transaction cost), Stakeholder Mining (Referral System via Airdrops), etc. Matchmaker: Auction/Reverse Auctions, Combinatorial Auctions, FreightCX (exchange). Polynomial-time-dependent bundle-matching, etc. Two additional concepts: liquidity and producer-consumer ratio. Provider Liquidity: \u201cthe percentage of listings that lead to transactions within a certain time period\u201d PC Ratio: We define this as the number of customers that one provider can serve. There is no single right ratio that all marketplaces should strive for. In some cases, the provider-to-customer ratio might be as low as 1:1 (one provider can serve only one customer \u2014 think real estate), while in others it may be as high as 1:10,000 (one provider can serve 10,000 customers \u2014 think stock photos). According to Phil Hu, Airbnb\u2019s figure is 1:70, Uber\u2019s is 1:50, and eBay\u2019s is 1:5. The more customers one provider can serve, the more you should focus on supply in the beginning. The math behind the reasoning is quite simple: when you are acquiring users by hand, acquiring a provider is more valuable than acquiring a customer since the provider will likely participate in more transactions. Another reason is that idle customers are more dangerous than idle providers.

underlying assets, semi-standardized contractual framework) Ownership of the commodity can be conveyed in some manner, and the commodity can be consumed.j Transfer of ownership includes transfer of intangible commodities, such that a contract that transfers ownership of intangible contruactual rights Aiding and abetting cases against smart contract coders may also implicate temporal issues that do not arise in typical aiding and abetting cases, where the aider and abettor\u2019s conduct occurs contemporaneously with the primary violator\u2019s conduct. In the _Thakkar _complaint, the CFTC emphasized that Thakkar\u2019s relationship with Trader A continued as Trader A engaged in spoofing. Smart contract coders may create code and make it available for use by others without necessarily knowing who is using the smart contract or why they are using it. Since most blockchain and smart contract projects are open source, the functionality that transforms a legitimate smart contract into one that triggers regulatory concerns may have been added by a developer who cannot be identified, at least without significant forensic analysis. There may also be cases where the transformation of the smart contract is incremental with different programmers involved at various stages. Determining the point where the smart contract became problematic, and who added that code, may be challenging. Indeed, the coder\u2019s substantive involvement with a smart contract may conclude long before others begin trading on their protocol. While smart contract coders may anticipate that activity, and may profit from it, they may not be \u201caware\u201d of the activity in the traditional sense. At a minimum, it will not be easy for the CFTC to build its case, and the Commission may need to rely on an expansive concept of knowledge to prevail.

standards are published by the Data Interchange Standards Association, Inc. Note Note TradeDocs is compliant as of 2020-06 with at least the following: 3060-X12, 3070-X12, 4010-X12, and 5010-X12 EDI 204 210 211 214 997 Default Supported, No Mapping Required Function of EDI Overview of EDI & Standards Diffreent standards define the commonly used business transactions in a formal, structured manner called transaction sets. X12 standards differ from data exchange protocols, in that a protocol allows data to flow from one computer to another without regard to the structure or meaning of the exchange. Character sets EDI consists of text data, and the text is restricted to using specific ASCII characters. A basic character set is defined for all exchanges, and this set may be extended with additional characters by mutual agreement of the trading partners. The characters described here are in universal use today, and using any additional characters is discouraged if not prohibited. Basic characters Uppercase letters A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z Numeric digits 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Special characters ! \" & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; ? = The space character Control characters: BEL HT LF VT FF CR FS GS RS US NL ASCII hex values: 07 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 1C 1D 1E 1F Extended characters Lowercase letters a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z Other special chars % ~ @ [ ] _ { } \\ | < > National characters # $ Control characters: SOH STX ETX EOT ENQ ACK DC1 DC2 DC3 DC4 NAK SYN ETB ASCII hex values: 01 02 03 04 05 06 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Delimiters Symbols representing delimiters Symbol Elements and higher structures of the EDI transaction sets are distinguished by `delimiters . Three delimiter values may be used: two levels of separators, for elements and sub-elements, and a terminator which indicates the end of a data segment. Delimiters are specified in the header of each interchange and shall not be used within a data element value elsewhere in the exchange. Actual characters used as delimiters are set within each exchange. Standards documentation indicates the use of a delimiter with symbols as shown in the sidebar. EDI standards do not impose requirements on delimiter choices other than to prohibit the use of a delimiter within a data element. Recommended delimiters are shown in the following table, along with values suggested in the standards and values in common use in industry: Delimiter EDI data is exchanged in different ways, but always comes down to encoding . Specifically the backtick and carat symbols are not included in the EDI character set, and therefore are not present in data elements. Please see our section on Codecs for more information on the subject. Data Elements The data element is the smallest named unit of information in the standard. Data elements are identified as either simple or component. A data element which occurs within a composite data structure is identified as a component data element. A data element which is outside the boundaries of a composite structure is a simple data element. The distinction between simple and component elements is based on the placement of the element in the set and not on the attributes of the element . Each data element is assigned a unique reference identifier of from one to four digits. Data elements have three attributes: the type, the length minimum, and the length maximum. Data element types are as follows: Type Numeric Decimal Identifier String Date Time Binary Fixed String Composite Data Structures The composite data structure is an intermediate unit of information in a segment. The definition of a composite data structure consists of two or more component data elements. In the actual data transmission the composite may consist of one or more component data elements. Adjacent component elements in a composite data structure are delimited by the component element separator . Composite data structures are delimited from other adjacent elements in a segment by the data element separator . Each composite data structure has a unique four-character reference identifier. The identifiers for composite data structures which appear in control segments start with an S; a C is the first letter of composite identifiers which are used in data segments. A detail table defines the component data elements in a composite data structure . Each component referenced has a requirement and an ordinal sequence in the structure. In the actual data transmission omitted elements are indicated by including their delimiters to preserve this sequence, except for elements which are omitted at the end of the component data structure. 1.component 2. component data structure 3. composite data structure 4. delimiter 5. segments Data Segment Structures The data segment is an intermediate unit of related information in a transaction set. Simple data elements and composite data structures are the data parts of the segment. Each segment in a transmission starts with the segment identifier, followed by at least one data element or component structure, and ending with a segment terminator . Each data segment has a unique two- or three-character identifier which also serves as a label for the segment in the data transmission. Segment labels are separated from the following data element by an element separator . The label is considered to be position zero of the segment, so that the first data element following the label is in position one. A detail table defines the sequence of simple data elements and composite data structures in a segment. Each unit referenced has a requirement and an ordinal sequence in the segment. Warning In the actual data transmission omitted elements are indicated by including their delimiters to preserve this sequence, except for elements which are omitted at the end of the segment. <!> Freight Trust Strictly Enforces which delimiters can be used Transaction Sets The transaction set is a complete unit of information exchanged between trading partners, representing a business document. Each transaction starts with a header segment (ST) and ends with a trailer segment (SE). At least one data segment is required between the header segment and the trailer. Each segment in the transaction set ends with the segment terminator . The transaction set identifier uniquely identifies each transaction set. This identifier is the first data element of the transaction set header segment. The transaction set header and trailer segments contain a control number which must be identical for any given transaction. Transaction set control numbers should not repeat in the history of exchanges of the transaction set between two trading partners. The transaction set trailer segment also contains a count of the number of segments in the transaction including the ST and SE segments. The sequence of data segments in a transaction set definition is presented in detail tables for the set. Up to three tables may be used to represent transaction header information, repeating details, and a summary area. Each segment in a set has a requirement designator, a position in the set definition, and a maximum occurrence. An example set detail table is shown below: Repeating Single data segments within a transaction set may repeat up to a specified maximum number of occurrences, as shown in the MaxUse column. The notation >1 is used to show that the number of repeats for a segment is unlimited. Groups of two or more related data segments may be repeated as a loop. Important Loops may be either unbounded, or bounded by loop start (LS) and loop end (LE) segments. Unbounded loops The start of an unbounded loop is marked by the occurrence of the first segment of the loop. The beginning segment of an unbounded loop shall not appear anywhere else in a loop. The requirement for a loop is implicitly the requirement of the loop\u2019s first segment . Designators Requirement Segment Designator If the requirement designator for the first segment of a loop is mandatory, then the loop must appear at least once in the transaction set`. A loop may be repeated up to a specified maximum number of times. The notation >1 designates an unlimited repeat. A level entry indicates the nesting of loops, and the start of a loop structure is indicated by a loop label on the first segment of the loop. When unbounded loops are nested within loops , the inner loop shall not start at the same position as any outer loop . The inner loop shall not start with the same segment identifier as the start of any outer loop, nor may the inner loop contain a segment that is also the beginning segment of any outer loop in the same structure. Tip The inner loop must end before or on the same segment as its immediate outer loop. Bounded loops The characteristics of unbounded loops also apply to bounded loops, except that bounded loops have no restriction on which segment begins the loop. For bounded loops, a unique loop identifier defined in the standard is used in the LS and LE segments to convey segment position or loop hierarchy, or both, within the transaction set. Transmission & Exchange Transmission Files A transmission consists of a sequence of interchanges in a stream which are all addressed to a specific trading partner (as when receiving) or all addressed from a specific partner (as when sending). The Sender and Receiver Identifiers in the ISA header of an interchange address the interchange envelope between partners. Therefore a transmission is analogous to a mail delivery to or a mail pickup from a mailbox. Transmission Diagram The sequence of control segments making up a transmission is displayed in the following figure: \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 \u2502 ISA \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 ISA/IEA Each interchange is bounded by an \u2502 \u2502 TA1 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \u2502 ISA/IEA segment pair. \u2502 \u2502 \u2026\u200b \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 GS \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 \u2502 TA1 Transmission Acknowledgment segments, \u2502 \u2502 ST \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 \u2502 \u2502 if used, immediately follow the ISA. \u2502 \u2502 \u2026\u200b\u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 SE \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 \u2502 \u2502 GS/GE Each Functional Group of similar \u2502 \u2502 \u2026\u200b \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \u2502 \u2502 transaction sets is bounded by a \u2502 \u2502 GE \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 \u2502 GS/GE segment pair. \u2502 \u2502 \u2026\u200b \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 IEA \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 ST/SE Each transaction set document starts \u2502 \u2502 ISA \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 with an ST and ends with an SE. \u2502 \u2502 \u2026\u200b \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 IEA \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 Each structure may repeat an arbitrary \u2502 \u2502 \u2026\u200b \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 number of times in its position. \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 ASC X12 License Content of ASC X12 standards is proprietary, and FreightTrust and Clearing Corporation makes no claim over its copyright, and only provides this for educational purposes only.

systems is a great oversight, since it is present at all times during system operation, whereas CAP is only relevant in the (arguably) rare case of a network partition. In fact, the consistency-latency tradeoff is potentially more significant than CAP, since it has a more direct effect of the baseline operations of modern distributed database systems. System Model and Components Important We use a reverse dependency model for establishing our architectural framework and overall design. This pattern is referred to as \"hexagonal\" The Blockchain serves as a global log of configuration and meta information. Through the blockchain component, network participants can register their existence along with verifiable data of their activities (such as schemas they use (e.g. X12 4010), service levels they guarantee (e.g. Web Services Agreement Specification , or contract terms with other participants). These transaction could used as input to automated arbitration of disputes per the guidelines setout in the Network Rulebook . [[nodelet: sequence, schedule, storage]] Node Layers The sequencing layer (or \u201csequencer\u201d) intercepts transactional inputs and places them into a global transactional input sequence\u2014this sequence will be the order of transactions to which all replicas will ensure serial equivalence during their execution. The sequencer therefore also handles the replication and logging of this input sequence. The scheduling layer (or \u201cscheduler\u201d) orchestrates transaction execution using a deterministic locking scheme to guarantee equivalence to the serial order specified by the sequencing layer while allowing transactions to be executed concurrently by a pool of transaction execution threads The storage layer handles all physical data layout. Sequencer and Replication [note]: epoch here does not mean the same as concensus epoch for validators 10-second epochs during which every machine\u2019s sequencer component collects transaction requests from clients. At the end of each epoch, all requests that have arrived at a sequencer node are compiled into a batch. This is the point at which replication of transactional inputs occurs. Checkpointing Deterministic database systems have two properties that simplify the task of ensuring fault tolerance. First, active replication allows clients to instantaneously failover to another replica in the event of a crash. Second, only the transactional input is logged\u2014there is no need to pay the overhead of physical REDO logging. Replaying history of transactional input is sufficient to recover the database system to the current state. However, it would be inefficient to replay the entire history of the database from the beginning of time upon every failure. Instead, the network operations * periodically takes a checkpoint of the network state in order to provide a starting point from which to begin replay during recovery. This is defined in the network configuration file .

UNCITRAL, 17(3) Control Exclusive Control Rotterdam Source: Miriam Goldby *Legal recognition of electronic alternatives to documents of title, 2011 * Two Modes of Lex Operandi American and English English Inclusion of Novation and Attornment # To a lawyer, a legal contract has a distinct meaning: A contract is an agreement giving rise to obligations which are enforced or recognised by law. The factor which distinguishes contractual from other legal obligations is that they are based on the agreement of the contracting parties7. For a contract to be valid, legal systems will impose certain requirements. Under English law, there are four key elements that must (usually) be satisfied: (i) one of the contracting parties must make an offer to contract and the other(s) must accept that offer; (ii) there must be \u2018consideration\u2019 for the offer, this being some form of value that must be exchanged; (iii) the parties must have an intention to form legal relations; and (iv) there must be certainty as to terms of the contract. Other systems of law may have other requirements \u2013 for example, under New York law, many legal contracts must be in writing and signed to become binding. - ISDA, \"Smart Contracts and Distributed Ledger \u2013 A Legal Perspective\" Other systems of law may have other requirements\u2009\u2014\u2009for example, under New York law, many legal contracts must be in writing and signed to become binding. Two Modes: National and International Contract Function Master Covenant RuleBook Agreement Master Participation Agreement Network Operator Agreement Transactional Clauses Amendment Clauses Business Terms and Conditions Intergration Clause National excludes lex mercatoria Clause < #> \u2013 Choice of law: lex mercatoria and Unidroit Principles This contract is governed by general principles of law generally recognized in international trade (lex mercatoria) together with the Unidroit Principles of International Commercial Contracts (except for Articles 2.20, 3.2.7 and 6.2.1). Clause < #> \u2013 Network Model Clause ?ref This contract shall be governed by the law of [State X] interpreted and supplemented by the Freight Trust Rule Book version < #> Clause 6.1 \u201cAny questions relating to this Agreement which are not expressly or implicitly settled by the provisions contained in this Agreement shall be governed, in the following order: 1) by the principles of law generally recognized in international trade as applicable to international [type of contract: e.g., distributorship, licence] contracts, 2) by the relevant trade usages, and 3) by the Unidroit Principles of International Commercial Contracts, with the exclusion of national laws.\u201d This clause, which is the most frequently used clause within the ICC model contracts, states that the contract shall be governed by the lex mercatoria and the Unidroit Principles and provides at the same time the following hierarchical order: 1. Contract provisions, 2. general principles of law applicable to the particular type of contract in question, 3. trade usages, 4. Unidroit Principles. Four Principles in creating IoL Four principles appear to be desirable and should insofar as it is possible be pursued together: the promotion of certainty and predictability; the promotion of uniformity of application; the protection of democratic ideals andensuring of jurisprudential deliberation, the retention of efficiency. Systems based approach Often when two companies deal with each other in the course of business, they will use standard form contracts. Often these standard forms contain terms which conflict (e.g. both parties include a liability waiver in their form). The 'battle of the forms' refers to the resulting legal dispute arising where both parties accept that a legally binding contract exists, but disagree about whose standard terms apply. Such disputes may be resolved by reference to the 'last document rule', i.e. whichever business sent the last document, or 'fired the last shot' (often the seller\u2019s delivery note) is held to have issued the final offer and the buyer\u2019s organisation is held to have accepted the offer by signing the delivery note or simply accepting and using the delivered goods. ~~RuleBook Changes ~~ RuleBook Clause Design Specifications The following criteria constitute the basis of the RuleBook program that identifies clauses hat do not serve the purpose of maininting a neutral legal framework. Rules\u2026\u200b that address problems that have not been defined that address problems that no longer exist that address more than one problem that lack a stated, measurable problemsolving goal, or purpose Laws that fail to achieve their goal Laws that lack a citation of references whose burdens are greater than their problemsolving benefit whose problemsolving benefit and burdens are equal whose results cannot be measured that interfere with other laws that duplicate other laws that have not undergone QA analysis within a specified time frame or approval process RuleBook ## Authorized Representative (a) Each Network Participant shall designate one or more Authorized Representatives to sign all instruments, correct errors, perform such other duties as may be required under the Rules and transact all business in connection with the operations of FreightTrust. Each Network Participant must provide FreightTrust with current contact and other requested information for each of its Authorized Representatives. (b) To designate an Authorized Representative, a Network Participant must provide the information requested and conform to the procedures and requirements established by Freight Trust. By agreeing to become an Authorized Representative, an individual agrees to be bound by the duties and responsibilities of an Authorized Representative and to be subject to, and comply with, the Rules and Obligations to the extent applicable. \u00a9 Freight Trust will promptly notify a Network Participant of the approval of nominated Authorized Representatives and will maintain a list of all approved Authorized Representatives for each Network Participant. Freight Trust shall promptly notif the parties involved if Freight Trust (i) declines to approve the designation, (ii) revokes the designation, or (iii) suspends the designation of an Authorized Representative or/and Network Participant. (d) An Authorized Representative who is suspended remains subject to the Rules and jurisdiction throughout the period of suspension. (e) To request the termination of the designation of an Authorized Representative, the Network Participant or the Authorized Representative must notify Freight Trust providing the information and complying with the procedures and requirements established by Freight Trust. (f) An Authorized Representative remains subject to the Rules and the jurisdiction of Freight Trust for acts done and omissions made while registered as such, and a proceeding relating to an individual whose designation as an Authorized Representative or Network Participant and has been terminated or suspended shall occur as if the Authorized Representative were still registered as such. Dispute Resolution All Network Participants shall be required to arbitrate all disputes between or among themselves that relate to or arise out of any transaction submitted for instrumentailization in accordance with this Rule Book. For these purposes, each Network Participant shall be deemed a \u201cParticipant\u201d for purposes of the rules set forth. Disputes involving Customers may be arbitrated in accordance to policy setforth in this Rule Book. Freight Specifics FCMSA Clauses Broker/Freight Forwader Property broker surety bond or trust fund.

Components Rosetta Modelling Components The Roseta syntax can express \ufb01ve types of model components : Data Annotafion Data Validafion (or condifion ) Funcfion Mapping (or synonym ) This documentafion details the purpose and features of each type of model component and highlights the relafionships that exist among those. As the inifial live applicafion of the Roseta DSL, examples from the ISDA CDM will be used to illustrate each of those features. Data Component The Roseta DSL provides four data de\ufb01nifion components that are used to model data, grouped into two pairs: Type and Atribute Enumerafion and Enumerafion Value Type and Attribute Purpose A type describes an enfity (also somefimes referred to as an object or a class ) in the model and is de\ufb01ned by a plain-text descripfion and a set of atributes . Atributes specify the granular elements composing the enfity. Syntax The de\ufb01nifion of a type starts with the keyword , followed by the type name. A colon punctuafion introduces the rest of the de\ufb01nifion. The \ufb01rst component of the de\ufb01nifion is a plain-text descripfion of the type. Descripfions use quotafion marks (to mark a string) in between angle brackets Descripfions, although not generafing any executable code, are integral meta-data components of the model. As modelling best pracfice, a de\ufb01nifion ought to exist for every artefact and be clear and comprehensive. Then the de\ufb01nifion of the type lists its component atributes. Each atribute is de\ufb01ned by four components, syntacfically ordered as: name type cardinality: see Cardinality Secfion descripfion \uf06a Note The Roseta DSL does not use any delimiter to end de\ufb01nifions. All model de\ufb01nifions start with a similar opening keyword as , so the start of a new de\ufb01nifion marks the end of the previous one. For readability more generally, the Roseta DSL looks to eliminate all the delimiters that are ohen used in tradifional programming languages (such as curly braces or semi-colon ). Each atribute can be speci\ufb01ed either as a basic type, a type or an enumerafion. The set of basic types available in the Roseta DSL are controlled at the language level by the de\ufb01nifion: Text - Number - Logic - (for integer) and (for \ufb02oat) Date and Time - , and The Roseta DSL convenfion is that type names use the PascalCase (starfing with a capital leter, also referred to as the upper CamelCase ), while atribute names use the camelCase (starfing with a lower case leter, also referred to as the lower camelCase). Type names need to be unique across the model. All those requirements are controlled by the Roseta DSL grammar. Time For fime zone adjustments, a fime zone quali\ufb01er can be speci\ufb01ed alongside a fime in one of two ways: Through the basic type, which needs to be expressed either as UTC or as an o\ufb00set to UTC, as speci\ufb01ed by the ISO 8601 standard. Through the type, where fime is speci\ufb01ed alongside a business center. This is used to specify a fime dimension in relafion to a future event: e.g. the earliest or latest exercise fime of an opfion. While there has been discussion as to whether the Roseta DSL should support dates which are speci\ufb01ed as an o\ufb00set to UTC with the su\ufb03x, no posifive conclusion has been reached. The main reason is that all dates which need a business date context can already specify an associated business center. Inheritance The Roseta DSL supports an inheritance mechanism , when a type inherits its de\ufb01nifion and behaviour (and therefore all of its atributes) from another type and adds its own set of atributes on top. Inheritance is supported by the keyword next to the type name. \uf06a Note For clarity purposes, the documentafion snippets omit the synonyms and de\ufb01nifions that are associated with the classes and atributes, unless the purpose of the snippet is to highlight some of those features. Enumeration and Enumeration Value Purpose Enumerafion is the mechanism through which an atribute may only take some speci\ufb01c controlled values . An enumerafion is the container for the corresponding set of controlled (or enumerafion) values. This mimics the scheme concept, whose values may be speci\ufb01ed as part of an exisfing standard and can be represented through an enumerafion in the Roseta DSL. Typically, a scheme with no de\ufb01ned values is represented as a basic type. Syntax Enumerafions are very simple modelling containers, which are de\ufb01ned in the same way as other model components. The de\ufb01nifion of an enumerafion starts with the keyword, followed by the enumerafion name. A colon punctuafion introduces the rest of the de\ufb01nifion, which contains a plain-text descripfion of the enumerafion and the list of enumerafion values. Enumerafion names must be unique across a model. The Roseta DSL naming convenfion is the same as for types and must use the upper CamelCase (PascalCase). In addifion the enumerafion name should end with the su\ufb03x Enum. Enumerafion values have a restricted syntax to facilitate their integrafion with executable code: they cannot start with a numerical digit, and the only special character that can be associated with them is the underscore . In order to handle the integrafion of scheme values which can have special characters, the Roseta DSL allows to associate a display name to any enumerafion value. For those enumerafion values, special characters are replaced with while the entry corresponds to the actual value. An example is the day count fracfion scheme for interest rate calculafion, which includes values such as to the and and These are associated as enumerafion values, respecfively. Annotation Component Annotation De\ufb01nition Purpose Annotafions allow to associate meta-informafion to model components, which can serve a number of purposes: purely syntacfic, to provide addifional guidance when navigafing model components to add constraints to a model that may be enforced by syntax validafion to modify the actual behaviour of a model in generated code Examples of annotafions and their usage for di\ufb00erent purposes are illustrated below. Syntax Annotafions are de\ufb01ned in the same way as other model components. The de\ufb01nifion of an annotafion starts with the keyword, followed by the annotafion name. A colon punctuafion introduces the rest of the de\ufb01nifion, starfing with a plain-text descripfion of the annotafion. Annotafion names must be unique across a model. The Roseta DSL naming convenfion is to use a (lower) camelCase. It is possible to associate atributes to an annotafion (see example), even though some annotafions may not require any further atribute. For instance: Meta-Data and Reference Purpose The and atributes. annotafion allows to associate a set of meta-data quali\ufb01ers to types Each atribute of the annotafion corresponds to a quali\ufb01er: The meta-data quali\ufb01er indicates a type that is referenceable, so that a unique idenfi\ufb01er can be associated to objects of that type. This allows to replicates the cross-referencing mechanism used in XML to provide data integrity within the context of an instance document. The replicates the meta- data as used in the FpML standard, which associates a cross-reference value to the object\u2019s data source. The types. meta-data quali\ufb01er provides the same funcfionality as but for basic The meta-data quali\ufb01er indicates that the atribute may be speci\ufb01ed as a reference, using the of a referenceable object as meta-data. This replicates the (for hyper-text reference ) meta-data as used in the FpML standard, where the cross-reference value may be speci\ufb01ed as meta-informafion in the atribute\u2019s data source. The meta-data quali\ufb01er speci\ufb01es a mechanism to control the set of values that an atribute can take. The relevant scheme reference may be speci\ufb01ed as meta-informafion in the atribute\u2019s data source, so that no originafing informafion is disregarded. The corresponds to a hash code to be generated by the model implementafion. The implementafion provided in the Roseta DSL is the de-facto Java hash funcfion. It is a deep hash that uses the complete set of atribute values that compose the type and its atributes, recursively. \uf06a Note Some annotafions, such as this metadata quali\ufb01cafion, may be provided as standard as part of the Roseta DSL itself. Addifional annotafions can always be de\ufb01ned for any model. Syntax Once an annotafion is de\ufb01ned, its name and chosen atribute, if any, are used in between square brackets to annotate model components. The below and types illustrate how meta-data annotafions and their relevant atributes can be used in a model: A the quali\ufb01er is associated to the type, the atribute of type type, which means it is referenceable. In quali\ufb01er, which is associated to the , indicates that this atribute can be provided as a reference (via its associated key) instead of a copy. An example implementafion of this cross-referencing mechanism for these types can be found in the Synonym Secfion of the documentafion. Partial Key Meta-data keys that are generated by a hashing algorithm from an object\u2019s atribute values ohen \ufb01nd a pracfical use by implementors for reconciling and matching data, where equality between hash values is considered a proxy for a data match. In some cases, it is necessary to remove some of an object\u2019s atribute values from the hashing algorithm, when those values are not required in the reconciliafion but risk adding noise in the hash that could generate false negafives. This is typically the case for meta-data quali\ufb01ers (such as meta-data keys), which may themselves be automafically generated by an algorithm. These may result in di\ufb00erences between two objects, even if those objects would have the same actual values. An implementafion of such parfial key used to be provided as a feature of the Roseta DSL (with a annotafion). It has now been de-commissioned, unfil further evaluafion of its usage emerges that may lead to a redesign of this feature. Quali\ufb01ed Type The Roseta DSL provides for some special types called quali\ufb01ed types , which are speci\ufb01c to its applicafion in the \ufb01nancial domain: Calculafion - Object quali\ufb01cafion - Those special types are designed to \ufb02ag atributes which result from running some logic, such that model implementafions can idenfify where to stamp the output in the model. The logic is being captured by speci\ufb01c types of funcfions that are detailed in the Funcfion De\ufb01nifion Secfion. Calculation The quali\ufb01ed type, when speci\ufb01ed instead of the type for the atribute, represents the outcome of a calculafion. An example usage is the conversion from clean price to dirty price for a bond. An atribute with the tagged with the funcfion output. type is meant to be associated to a funcfion annotafion. The atribute\u2019s type is implied by the Object Quali\ufb01cation Similarly, and represent the outcome of quali\ufb01cafion logic to infer the type of an object (\ufb01nancial product or event) in the model. See the atribute, alongside other idenfi\ufb01er atributes in the type: Atributes of these types are meant to be associated to an object quali\ufb01cafion funcfion tagged with the annotafion. The annotafion has an atribute to specify which type of object (like or ) is being quali\ufb01ed. \uf06a Note The quali\ufb01ed type feature in the Roseta DSL is under evaluafion and may be replaced by a mechanism that is purely based on these funcfion annotafions in the future. Data Validation Component Data integrity is supported by validafion components that are associated to each data type in the Roseta DSL. There are two types of validafion components: Cardinality Condifion Statement The validafion components associated to a data type generate executable code designed to be executed on objects of that type. Implementors of the model can use the code generated from these validafion components to build diagnosfic tools that can scan objects and report on which validafion rules were safis\ufb01ed or broken. Typically, the validafion code is included as part of any process that creates an object, to verify its validity from the point of creafion. Cardinality Cardinality is a data integrity mechanism to control how many of each atribute an object of a given type can contain. The Roseta DSL borrows from XML and speci\ufb01es cardinality as a lower and upper bound in between braces. The lower and upper bounds can both be any integer number. A 0 lower bound means atribute is opfional. A upper bound means an unbounded atribute. represents that there must be one and only one atribute of this type. When the upper bound is greater than 1, the atribute will be considered as a list, to be handled as such in any generated code. A separate validafion rule is generated for each atribute\u2019s cardinality constraint, so that any cardinality breach can be associated back to the speci\ufb01c atribute and not just to the object overall. Condition Statement Purpose Condifions are logic statements associated to a data type. They are predicates on atributes of objects of that type that evaluate to True or False. Syntax Condifion statements are included in the de\ufb01nifion of the type that they are associated to and are usually appended aher the de\ufb01nifion of the type\u2019s atributes. The de\ufb01nifion of a condifion starts with the keyword, followed by the name of the condifion and a colon punctuafion. The condifion\u2019s name must be unique in the context of the type that it applies to (but does not need to be unique across all data types of a given model). The rest of the condifion de\ufb01nifion comprises: a plain-text descripfion (opfional) a logic expression that applies to the the type\u2019s atributes The Roseta DSL o\ufb00ers a restricted set of language features designed to be unambiguous and understandable by domain experts who are not sohware engineers, while minimising unintenfional behaviour. The Roseta DSL is not a Turing-complete language: it does not support looping constructs that can fail (e.g. the loop never ends), nor does it nafively support concurrency or I/O operafions. The language features that are available in the Roseta DSL to express validafion condifions emulate the basic boolean logic available in usual programming languages: condifional statements: , , boolean operators: , list statements: , , , comparison operators: , , , , , \uf06a Note Condifions are included in the de\ufb01nifion of the data type that they are associated to, so they are \u201caware\u201d of the context of that data type. This is why atributes of that data type can be directly used to express the validafion logic, without the need to refer to the type itself. Special Syntax Some speci\ufb01c language features have been introduced in the Roseta DSL, to handle validafion cases where the basic boolean logic components would create unecessarily verbose, and therefore less readable, expressions. Those use-cases were deemed frequent enough to jusfify developing a speci\ufb01c syntax for them. Choice Choice rules de\ufb01ne a choice constraint between the set of atributes of a type in the Roseta DSL. They allow a simple and robust construct to translate the XML xsd:choicesyntax , although their usage is not limited to those XML use cases. The choice constraint can be either: opfional , represented by the atributes needs to be present, or required , represented by the atributes needs to be present syntax, when at most one of the syntax, when exactly one of the While most of the choice rules have two atributes, there is no limit to the number of atributes associated with it, within the limit of the number of atributes associated with the type. \uf06a Note Members of a choice rule need to have their lower cardinality set to 0, something which is enforced by a validafion rule. One-of (as complement to choice rule) In the case where all the atributes of a given type are subject to a required choice logic that results in one and only one of them being present in any instance of that type, the Roseta DSL allows to associate a condifion to the type, as short- hand to by-pass the implementafion of the corresponding choice rule. This feature is illustrated below: Only Exists The component is an adaptafion of the simple syntax, that veri\ufb01es that the atribute exists but also that no other atribute of the type does. This syntax drasfically reduces the condifion expression, which would otherwise require to combine one with mulfiple (applied to all other atributes). It also makes the logic more robust to future model changes, where newly introduced atributes would need to be tested for . \uf06a Note This condifion is typically applied to atribues of objects whose type implements a condifion. In this case, the quali\ufb01er is redundant with the condifion because only one of the atributes can exist. However, makes the condifion expression more explicit, and also robust to potenfial lihing of the condifion. Function Component In programming languages, a funcfion is a \ufb01xed set of logical instrucfions returning an output which can be parameterised by a set of inputs (also known as arguments ). A funcfion is invoked by specifying a set of values for the inputs and running the instrucfions accordingly. In the Roseta DSL, this type of component has been uni\ufb01ed under a single funcfion construct. Funcfions are a fundamental building block to automate processes, because the same set of instrucfions can be executed as many fimes as required by varying the inputs to generate a di\ufb00erent, yet determinisfic, result. Just like a spreadsheet allows users to de\ufb01ne and make use of funcfions to construct complex logic, the Roseta DSL allows to model complex processes from reusable funcfion components. Typically, complex processes are de\ufb01ned by combining simpler sub-processes, where one process\u2019s output can feed as input into another process. Each of those processes and sub-processes are represented by a funcfion. Funcfions can invoke other funcfions, so they can represent processes made up of sub- processes, sub-sub-processes, and so on. Reusing small, modular processes has the following bene\ufb01ts: Consistency . When a sub-process changes, all processes that use the sub- process bene\ufb01t from that single change. Flexibility . A model can represent any process by reusing exisfing sub-processes. There is no need to de\ufb01ne each process explicitly: instead, we pick and choose from a set of pre-exisfing building blocks. Where widely adopted industry processes already exist, they should be reused and not rede\ufb01ned. Some examples include: Mathemafical funcfions. Funcfions such as sum, absolute, and average are widely understood, so do not need to be rede\ufb01ned in the model. Reference data. The process of looking-up through reference data is usually provided by exisfing industry ufilifies and a model should look to re-use it but not re-implement it. Quanfitafive \ufb01nance. Many quanfitafive \ufb01nance solufions, some open-source, already de\ufb01nes granular processes such as: compufing a coupon schedule from a set of parameters adjusfing dates given a holiday calendar This concept of combining and reusing small components is also consistent with a modular component approach to modelling. Function Speci\ufb01cation Purpose Funcfion speci\ufb01cafion components are used to de\ufb01ne the processes applicable to a domain model in the Roseta DSL. A funcfion speci\ufb01cafion de\ufb01nes the funcfion\u2019s inputs and/or output through their types (or enumerafions ) in the data model. This amounts to specifying the API that implementors should conform to when building the funcfion that supports the corresponding process. Standardising those APIs guarantees the integrity, inter-operability and consistency of the automated processes supported by the domain model. Syntax Funcfions are de\ufb01ned in the same way as other model components. The syntax of a funcfion speci\ufb01cafion starts with the keyword followed by the funcfion name. A colon punctuafion introduces the rest of the de\ufb01nifion. The Roseta DSL convenfion for a funcfion name is to use a PascalCase (upper CamelCase ) word. The funcfion name needs to be unique across all types of funcfions in a model and validafion logic is in place to enforce this. The rest of the funcfion speci\ufb01cafion supports the following components: plain-text decripfions inputs and output atributes (the later is mandatory) condifion statements on inputs and output output construcfion statements Descriptions The role of a funcfion must be clear for implementors of the model to build applicafions that provide such funcfionality. To beter communicate the intent and use of funcfions, Roseta supports mulfiple plain-text descripfions in funcfions. Descripfions can be provided for the funcfion itself, for any input and output and for any statement block. Look for occurences of text descripfions in the snippets below. Inputs and Output Inputs and output are a funcfion\u2019s equivalent of a type\u2019s atributes. As in a , each atribute is de\ufb01ned by a name, data type (as either a , or ) and cardinality. At minimum, a funcfion must specify its output atribute, using the keyword also followed by a colon . Most funcfions, however, also require inputs, which are also expressed as atributes, using the keyword. is plural whereas is singular, because a funcfion may only return one type of output but may take several types of inputs. Conditions A funcfion\u2019s inputs and output can be constrained using condifions . Each condifion is expressed as a logical statement that evaluates to True or False, using the same language features as those available to express condifion statements in data types and detailed in the Condifion Statement Secfion. Condifion statements in a funcfion can represent either: a pre-condifion , using the keyword, applicable to inputs only and evaluated prior to execufing the funcfion, or a post-condifion , using the keyword, applicable to inputs and output and evaluated aher execufing the funcfion (once the output is known) Condifions are an essenfial feature of the de\ufb01nifion of a funcfion. By constraining the inputs and output, they de\ufb01ne the constraints that impementors of this funcfion must safisfy, so that it can be safely used for its intended purpose as part of a process. func EquityPriceObservation: < \"Function specification for the observation of an equity price, based on the attributes of the 'EquityValuation' class.\"> inputs: equity Equity (1..1) valuationDate AdjustableOrRelativeDate (1..1) valuationTime BusinessCenterTime (0..1) timeType TimeTypeEnum (0..1) determinationMethod DeterminationMethodEnum (1..1) output: observation ObservationPrimitive (1..1) condition: < \"Optional choice between directly passing a time or a timeType, which has to be resolved into a time based on the determination method.\"> if valuationTime exists then timeType is absent else if timeType exists then valuationTime is absent else False post-condition: < \"The date and time must be properly resolved as attributes on the output.\"> observation \u2192 date = ResolveAdjustableDate(valuationDate) and if valuationTime exists then observation \u2192 time = TimeZoneFromBusinessCenterTime(valuationTime) else observation \u2192 time = ResolveTimeZoneFromTimeType(timeType, determinationMethod) post-condition: < \"The number recorded in the observation must match the number fetched from the source.\"> observation \u2192 observation = EquitySpot(equity, observation \u2192 date, observation \u2192 time) \uf06a Note The funcfion syntax intenfionally mimics the type syntax in the Roseta DSL regarding the use of descripfions, atributes (inputs and output) and condifions, to provide consistency in the expression of model de\ufb01nifions. Function De\ufb01nition The Roseta DSL allows to further de\ufb01ne the business logic of a funcfion , by building the funcfion output instead of just specifying the funcfion\u2019s API. The creafion of valid output objects can be fully or parfially de\ufb01ned as part of a funcfion speci\ufb01cafion, or completely leh to the implementor. A funcfion is fully de\ufb01ned when all validafion constraints on the output object have been safis\ufb01ed as part of the funcfion speci\ufb01cafion. In this case, the generated code is directly usable in an implementafion. A funcfion is parfially de\ufb01ned when the output object\u2019s validafion constraints are only parfially safis\ufb01ed. In this case, implementors will need to extend the generated code and assign the remaining values on the output object. A funcfion must be applied to a speci\ufb01c use case in order to determine whether it is fully de\ufb01ned or parfially de\ufb01ned . There are a number of fully de\ufb01ned funcfion cases explained in further detail below. The Roseta DSL only provides a limited set of language features. To build the complete processing logic for a parfially de\ufb01ned funcfion, model implementors are meant to extend the code generated from the Roseta DSL once it is expressed in a fully featured programming language. For instance in Java, a funcfion speci\ufb01cafion generates an interface that needs to be extended to be executable. The output object will be systemafically validated when invoking a funcfion, so all funcfions require the output object to be fully valid as part of any model implementafion. Output Construction In the example above, the statements assert whether the observafion\u2019s date and value are correctly populated according to the output of other, sub-funcfions, but delegates the construcfion of that output to implementors of the funcfion. In pracfice, implementors of the funcfion can be expected to re-use those sub- funcfions ( and ) to construct the output. The drawback is that those sub-funcfions are likely to be executed twice: once to build the output and once to run the validafion. For e\ufb03ciency, the funcfion syntax in the Roseta DSL allows to directly build the output by assigning its values. Funcfion implementors do not have to build those values themselves, because the funcfion already provides them by default, so the corresponding post-condifions are redundant and can be removed. The example above could be rewriten as follows: The Roseta DSL also supports a number of fully de\ufb01ned funcfion cases , where the output is being built up to a valid state: Object quali\ufb01cafion Calculafion Short-hand funcfion Those funcfions are typically associated to an annotafion, as described in the Quali\ufb01ed Type Secfion, to instruct code generators to create concrete funcfions. Object Quali\ufb01cation Function The Roseta DSL supports the quali\ufb01cafion of \ufb01nancial objects from their underlying components according to a given classi\ufb01cafion taxonomy, in order to support a composable model for those objects (e.g. \ufb01nancial products, legal agreements or their associated lifecycle events). Object quali\ufb01cafion funcfions evaluate a combinafion of asserfions that uniquely characterise an input object according to a chosen classi\ufb01cafion. Each funcfion is associated to a quali\ufb01cafion name (a from that classi\ufb01cafion) and returns a boolean. This boolean evaluates to True when the input safis\ufb01es all the criteria to be idenfi\ufb01ed according to that quali\ufb01cafion name. Object quali\ufb01cafion funcfions are associated to a annotafion that speci\ufb01es the type of object being quali\ufb01ed. The funcfion name start with the pre\ufb01x, followed by an underscore upper CamelCase (PascalCase) word, using The naming convenfion is to have an to append granular quali\ufb01cafion names where the classi\ufb01cafion may use other types of separators (like space or colon ). Syntax validafion logic based on the this. annotafion is in place to enforce Calculation Function Calculafion funcfions de\ufb01ne a calculafion output that is ohen, though not exclusively, of type They must end with an statement that fully de\ufb01nes the calculafion result. Calculafion funcfions are associated to the annotafion. Alias The funcfion syntax supports the de\ufb01nifion of aliases that are only available in the context of the funcfion. Aliases work like temporary variable assignments used in programming languages and are parficularly useful in fully de\ufb01ned funcfions. The above example builds an interest rate calculafion using aliases to de\ufb01ne the calculafion amount , rate and day count fracfion as temporary variables, and \ufb01nally assigns the \ufb01xed amount output as the product of those three variables. Short-Hand Function Short-hand funcfions are funcfions which are designed to provide a compact syntax for operafions that need to be frequently invoked in the model - for instance, model indirecfions when the corresponding model expression may be deemed too long or cumbersome: which could be invoked as part of mulfiple other funcfions that use the object by simply stafing: Mapping Component Synonym Purpose Synonym is the baseline building block to map a model expressed in the Roseta DSL to alternafive data representafions, whether those are open standards or proprietary. Synonyms can be complemented by mapping logic when the relafionship is not a one-to-one or is condifional. Synonyms are speci\ufb01ed at the atribute level for a data type. Synonyms can also be associated to enumerafions and are speci\ufb01ed at the enumerafion value level. Mappings are typically implemented by traversing the model tree down, so knowledge of the context of an atribute (i.e. the type in which it is used) determines what it should map to. Knowledge about the upper-level type would be lost if synonyms were implemented at the class level. There is no limit to the number of synonyms that can be associated to any atribute, and there can even be several synonyms for a given data source (e.g. in the case of a condifional mapping). Syntax Synonyms are introduced by the atribute in between square brackets synonym syntax has two components: keyword and are speci\ufb01ed for each , same as an annotafion. The baseline source , which possible values are controlled by a special enumerafion type of value , which is a the source For example for a data type: that idenfi\ufb01es the name of the atribute as it is found in Or an enumerafion: enum NaturalPersonRoleEnum: < \"The enumerated values for the natural person\u2019s role.\"> Broker < \"The person who arranged with a client to execute the trade.\"> [synonym FpML_5_10 , CME_SubmissionIRS_1_0 , CME_ClearedConfirm_1_17 value \"Broker\"] Buyer < \"Acquirer of the legal title to the financial instrument.\"> [synonym FpML_5_10, CME_SubmissionIRS_1_0, CME_ClearedConfirm_1_17 value \"Buyer\"] DecisionMaker < \"The party or person with legal responsibility for authorization of the execution of the transaction.\"> synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"DecisionMaker\" synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"DecisionMaker\" ExecutionWithinFirm < \"Person within the firm who is responsible for execution of the transaction.\"> synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"ExecutionWithinFirm\" synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"ExecutionWithinFirm\" InvestmentDecisionMaker < \"Person who is responsible for making the investment decision.\"> synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"InvestmentDecisionMaker\" synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"InvestmentDecisionMaker\" Seller < \"Seller of the legal title to the financial instrument.\"> [synonym FpML_5_10, CME_SubmissionIRS_1_0, CME_ClearedConfirm_1_17 value \"Seller\"] Trader < \"The person who executed the trade.\"> synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"Trader\" synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"Trader\" \uf06a Note The synonym value is of type to facilitate integrafion with executable code. The alternafive approach consisfing of specifying the value as a compafible idenfi\ufb01er alongside a display name has been disregarded because it has been deemed not appropriate to create a \u201ccode-friendly\u201d value for the respecfive synonyms. A further set of atributes can be associated with a synonym, to address speci\ufb01c use cases: path to allow mapping when data is nested in mulfiple levels within the respecfive model. hint to allow mapping when data is nested in di\ufb00erent ways between the respecfive models. The type provides a good illustrafion of such cases: type Price: < \"Generic description of the price concept applicable across product types, which can be expressed in a number of ways other than simply cash price\"> cashPrice CashPrice (0..1) < \"Price specified in cash terms, e.g. for securities proceeds or fee payment in a contractual product.\"> [synonym FpML_5_10 value \"initialPrice\" path \"rateOfReturn\", \"underlyer\"] [synonym FpML_5_10 hint \"paymentAmount\"] synonym FpML\\_5\\_10 hint \"fixedAmount\" synonym FpML\\_5\\_10 hint \"fixedAmount\" exchangeRate ExchangeRate (0..1) < \"Price specified as an exchange rate between two currencies.\"> synonym FpML\\_5\\_10 value \"exchangeRate\" synonym FpML\\_5\\_10 value \"exchangeRate\" fixedInterestRate FixedInterestRate (0..1) < \"Price specified as a fixed interest rate.\"> synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"fixedRateSchedule\" path \"calculationPeriodAmount\u2192calculation\" synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"fixedRateSchedule\" path \"calculationPeriodAmount\u2192calculation\" synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"fixedAmountCalculation\" synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"fixedAmountCalculation\" synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"fixedRateSchedule\" synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"fixedRateSchedule\" synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 hint \"fixedRate\" synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 hint \"fixedRate\" floatingInterestRate FloatingInterestRate (0..1) < \"Price specified as a spread on top of a floating interest rate.\" synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"floatingRateCalculation\" path \"calculationPeriodAmount\u2192calculation\" synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"floatingRateCalculation\" path \"calculationPeriodAmount\u2192calculation\" synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"floatingRateCalculation\" path \"interestCalculation\" synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"floatingRateCalculation\" path \"interestCalculation\" synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"floatingRateCalculation\" synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"floatingRateCalculation\" synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"floatingAmountCalculation\" synonym FpML\\_5\\_10, CME\\_SubmissionIRS\\_1\\_0, CME\\_ClearedConfirm\\_1\\_17 value \"floatingAmountCalculation\" tag or a componentID to properly re\ufb02ect the FIX standard, which uses those two components. There are only limited examples of such at present, as a result of the scope focus on post-execufion use cases hence the limited reference to the FIX standard. de\ufb01nifion to provide a more explicit reference to the FIX enumerafion values which are speci\ufb01ed through a single digit or leter posifioned as a pre\ufb01x to the associated de\ufb01nifion. Meta-Data Mapping When meta-data are associated to an atribute, as decribed in the Meta-Data and Reference Secfion, addifional synonym syntax allows to specify how to retrieve the corresponding meta-data from the source. This is illustrated by the usage of the synonym syntax in the example below: The atribute has an associated The scheme can be retrieved using the source. meta-data that is atached to the value in the synonym To be able to specify an atribute as a reference from an exisfing source, the source itself must implement some cross-referencing mechanism so that the reference can be idenfi\ufb01ed, as in the works as follows: / mechanism used in XML. The cross-referencing the atribute must specify the idenfi\ufb01er value for the reference in the synonym source. For the meta-data of the atribute above, this is speci\ufb01ed as the value in the source. an idenfi\ufb01er value must be associated to the object being referenced. For the type, this is speci\ufb01ed as the shown below: meta-data in the synonym source, as The below JSON extract illustrates an implementafion of these meta-data in the context of a transacfion event , which idenfi\ufb01es the parfies to the transacfions as well as the issuer of the event (i.e. who submits the transacfion message). There are two parfies to the event, associated with idenfi\ufb01ers as \u201cparty1\u201d and \u201cparty2\u201d. Their actual are speci\ufb01ed through an FpML values are \u201cParty 1\u201d and \u201cParty 2\u201d, which referred to in meta-data. Roseta also associates an internal meta-data. hash to each party, as implementafion of the Thanks to the quali\ufb01er, the atribute can simply reference the event issuer party as \u201cParty 2\u201d rather than duplicafing its components. The cross-reference is sourced from the original FpML document using the implemented synonym. The internal points to the hash while the points to the \u201cparty2\u201d , as sourced from the original FpML document. Also note that the itself has an associated meta-data by default since its class has a quali\ufb01er. \uf06a Note This example is not part of the Roseta DSL but corresponds to the default JSON implementafion of the model. The choice of either maintaining or shredding external references (such as \u201cparty2\u201d), once cross-reference has been established using the source document, is up to implementors of the model. Mapping Rule Purpose There are cases where the mapping between exisfing standards and protocols and their relafion to the model is not one-to-one or is condifional. Synonyms have been complemented with a syntax to express mapping logic that provides a balance between \ufb02exibility and legibility. Syntax The mapping rule syntax di\ufb00ers from the normal Roseta DSL syntax in that it is not expressed as a stand-alone block with a quali\ufb01er pre\ufb01x such as . Instead, the mapping rule is posifioned as an extension of the synonym syntax. Several mapping rule expressions can be associated with a given synonym. A mapping rule is composed of two (opfional) expressions: mapping value pre\ufb01xed with , which speci\ufb01es the value that the atribute should be set to when the condifional expression is true condifional expression pre\ufb01xed with mapping value , to associate condifional logic to the The mapping logic associated with the party role example below provides a good illustrafion of such logic: Last updated 2020-06-23 21:25:23 -0700","title":"Output"},{"location":"papers/safety-and-continiuty/","text":"/* Asciidoctor default stylesheet | MIT License | https://asciidoctor.org */ /*

Exogenus Event Planning IT Security Fail Safe Mechanism Smart contracts may not include appropriate or sufficient backup / failover mechanisms in case something goes awry. Smart contracts may depend on other systems to fulfill contract terms. These other systems may have vulnerabilities that could prevent the smart contract from functioning as intended. Some smart contract platforms may be missing critical system safeguards and customer protections. Where smart contracts are linked to a blockchain, forks in the chain could create operational problems. In case of an operational failure, recourse may be limited or non-existent\u2009\u2014\u2009complete loss of a virtual asset is possible. Poor governance.

It\u2019s intended to be used early in a performance investigation, to identify systemic bottlenecks. Terminology definitions: resource: all physical server functional components (CPUs, disks, busses, \u2026\u200b) [1] utilization: the average time that the resource was busy servicing work [2] saturation: the degree to which the resource has extra work which it can\u2019t service, often queued errors: the count of error events The metrics are usually expressed in the following terms: utilization: as a percent over a time interval. eg, \"one disk is running at 90% utilization\". saturation: as a queue length. eg, \"the CPUs have an average run queue length of four\". errors: scalar counts. eg, \"this network interface has had fifty late collisions\". Resource List CPUs: sockets, cores, hardware threads (virtual CPUs) utilization, saturation Memory: capacity utilization, saturation Network interfaces utilization Storage devices: I/O, capacity utilization, saturation, errors Controllers: storage, network cards Interconnects: CPUs, memory, I/O JVM Java Virtual Machine Tuning Using Azul Zulu Community Zulu Community download page SHA256: df0de67998ac0c58b3c9e83c86e2a81daca05dc5adc189d942bc5d3f4691e749 Download zulu11.39.15-ca-jdk11.0.7-linux_x64.tar.gz Certification QA from Azul 11.0.7+10 Zulu: 11.39.15 Linux glibc v2.5 or higher -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseZGC Since in current HotSpot JVM implementation (as well as in some others) GC logging can be blocked by background IO activities, there are various solutions that can help mitigate this problem when writing to GC log file. First, the JVM implementation could be enhanced to completely address this issue. Particularly, if the GC logging activities are separated from the critical JVM GC processes that cause STW pauses, then this problem will go away. For instance, JVM can put the GC logging function into a different thread which handles the log file writing independently, hence not contributing to the STW pauses. Taking the separate-thread approach however risks losing last GC log information during JVM crash. It might make sense to expose a JVM flag allowing users to specify their preference. Since the extent of STW pauses caused by background IO depends on how heavy the latter is, various ways to reduce the background IO intensity can be applied. For instance, de-allocating other IO-intensive applications on the same node, reducing other types of logging, improving on the log rotation, etc. For latency-sensitive applications such as online ones serving interactive users, large STW pauses (e.g., >0.25 seconds) are intolerable. Hence, special treatments need to be applied. The bottom line of ensuring no big STW pauses induced by OS is to avoid GC logging being blocked by OS IO activities.

If the buffers are too small, the TCP congestion window will never fully open up. If the receiver buffers are too large, TCP flow control breaks and the sender can overrun the receiver, which will cause the TCP window to shut down. This is likely to happen if the sending host is faster than the receiving host. The optimal buffer size is twice the bandwidth*delay product of the link: buffer size = 2 * bandwidth * delay For example, if your ping time is 50 ms, and the end-to-end network consists of all 1G or 10G Ethernet, the TCP buffers should be: .05 sec * (1 Gbit / 8 bits) = 6.25 MBytes. Network Disk Performance 10485760, 0xa00000 I/O 4,096 bytes = 4.096 kb As you fill the SSD-based instance store volumes for your instance, the number of write IOPS that you can achieve decreases. This is due to the extra work the SSD controller must do to find available space, rewrite existing data, and erase unused space so that it can be rewritten. This process of garbage collection results in internal write amplification to the SSD, expressed as the ratio of SSD write operations to user write operations. This decrease in performance is even larger if the write operations are not in multiples of 4,096 bytes or not aligned to a 4,096-byte boundary. If you write a smaller amount of bytes or bytes that are not aligned, the SSD controller must read the surrounding data and store the result in a new location. This pattern results in significantly increased write amplification, increased latency, and dramatically reduced I/O performance. source, aws.

OpenZeppelin EthWaffle Gnosis Lib Instruments Packages Auditing and Security While security affects all of software development, security in smart contracts is particularly important. Anyone can send a transaction directly to your contracts with any payload, and all your contract code and state is publicly accessible. Security is a primary concern at all stages of development. This means that **security is not something that we sprinkle on any project, but a guiding principle since day one. We follow Consensys smart contract security best practices We also adhere to the quality checklist to ensure perofrmance and quality. < < < Key Management When working with private keys proper procedure should be followed that is outline in our Security Policy. The accounts we use to deploy and interact with our contractss and network we try and take every precaution to protect our keys. Users should consider using a hardware wallet if necessary and providing for backups in a secure, offline storage vehicle. Additionally, we have defined certain accounts to have special privileges in our system - and have taken extra care to secure them. Admin Accounts An admin (short for administrator ) account is one that has special privileges in our system. For example, an admin may have the power to pause a contract. For securing admin accounts we use a special contract, such as a multisig, instead of a regular externally owned account. A multisig is a contract that can execute any action, as long as a predefined number of trusted members agree upon it . Gnosis Safe is one of the systems we use to employ admin keys. Upgrades Admin A special administrator account is the account with the power to upgrade other contracts. This defaults to the externally owned account used to deploy the contracts. OTE: Note In a standard OpenZeppelin project, all proxies are actually managed by a central ownership contract named the ProxyAdmin, which is in turn owned by the deploying account. Running set-admin on all instances will change the owner of the ProxyAdmin on an atomic transaction. Alternatively, you can change the admin of individual proxies.

our current token model, and propose several changes in order to maximize value accrual as the network opens for public (i.e. business) usage. Much of this work is based on sources found at the end, and we would like to thank everyone who offered their critiques and thoughts on the subject. Examining the \u201cbifurcated\u201d token model (having 2 tokens: a transactional token (network native) and a \u201csystem\u201d token (erc-20) is shown to be a better model than a traditional singular token model. Protocol On Protocols \"Protocols encode the rules of engagement that coordinate the exchange of a service between a global supplier and global consumer.\" \u2014 Chris Burniske Protocols As Minimally Extractive Coordinators Protocols provide structure for businesses, but are not businesses themselves; they are systems of logic that coordinate exchange between suppliers (businesses) and consumers of a service. As coordinators of exchange, protocols should be minimally extractive, whereas businesses are incentivized to be maximally extractive (that\u2019s profit, and a business is valued as a multiple of its profit). The ERC-20 token, $EDI, acts as a right to receive the native network asset, xEDI on demand. xEDI does not act as a right to receive any other asset, instead, it grants the right to transact on the network-based upon market conditions and pricing. This does not preclude a trading mechanism from existing: we simply enforce a one-way mechanism for EDI to xEDI. Nodes and Nodlets Tip 1 Validator has 3 Nodlets making the total of 4 \"containers\"/\"servers\" Gmemory Gtxcreate Gtxdatazero Gtxdatanonzero Gtransaction ext4 EDI Tthroughput Block Size checkpoint increment Rocksdb epoch Nodes Masternodes == Nodes. All nodes are technically the same. The classifications below are more specifically slots . Nodes are rotated into different slot positions over an epoch . An epoch is defined in terms of checkpoint increment authority: concensus signing node validator: failover Nodlet besu-tx: Handling of local transaction pool. besu-sync: Handling of blockchain synchronisation through Ethereum P2P network. besu-query: Handling of database queries. Threshold Utility Level The ERC-20 token, $EDI , can enable access to the network level operator system, commonly referred to as \"master nodes\". This is both a network and a legal operation as operators are part of a limited partnership that is compensated from Freight Trust Inc. Network operation is distributed amongst \u201cMaster Nodes\u201d. An amount of $EDI is required, x, in order to be able to be eligible for hosting part of the main network. Categories for Network Operations {\"Category\":\"Nodes\",\"Item\":\"Authority,Validator,Failover\"}, {\"Category\":\"Nodlet\",\"Item\":\"query,sync,transaction\"}, {\"Category\":\"Nodes\",\"Item\":\"Authority,Validator,Failover\"}, {\"Category\":\"Nodlet\",\"Item\":\"query,sync,transaction\"}, End-market fundamentals In our use case, we assume that the platform will accrue transaction volumes at a consistent dollar rate per user transaction set (e.g. EDI transaction to a trading partner). This transaction volume would likely be composed of an end-user directly paying for the transaction on a per kilobyte basis. Value flows being distributed in the native cryptoasset requires an exogenous assumption to form a base of value , and even then, the supply-side\u2019s assessment of the value they\u2019re receiving can be unpredictable given the native asset\u2019s volatility. We can make the assumption that at equilibrium the service should be 1/10 th the cost of a service provisioned by a company comparable (e.g., storage at 1/10 th the cost of AWS), as only networks that are more efficient than companies will be able to get demand-sides to make the leap. The cost of the service can then be pinpointed, the units of the service consumed can be projected, and the product of the two is the value stream flowing to the supply-side. That value stream is what the cryptocapital has claim to, and so the capital asset component of value can be assessed. The \u201coutside\u201d anchor is the cost of comparable services that the cryptonetwork (freight trust network) will be competing with, though trouble remains if the native cryptoasset is too volatile, as that volatility influences the supply-sides\u2019 perception of what they\u2019re getting paid. Freight Trust, Inc includes a few \u201clegacy\u201d mechanisms to address this point, such as payment to node operators in fiat, thus establishing a fixed cost floor. Governance mechanisms in general should: 1) Attract a willing supply-side that produces the resource (node operators, stakeholders, community et al) 2) Connect that resource to a demand-side that values and is willing to pay for the resource (businesses) 3) It creates an open layer of access to the underlying resource for distributors that want to build the last mile to the consumer. (Freight Trust Corporate) As of right now, no formal governance mechanism besides the informal RFC process exists for EDI. We plan in the following days to formally propose a new governance mechanism based upon Dynamic Alignment. We have included a graphic to illustrate the idea behind it Last updated 2020-06-23 21:25:23 -0700","title":"Util"},{"location":"rulebook/","text":"Network Rulebook This rulebook governs and provides instructions for the adjudication, regulation and governance over the Freight Trust Network.

(A). Upon matching of a trade effected on or pursuant to the rules of the Exchange, the Exchange shall promptly submit to FreightTrust Clearing a trade report generated by the electronic trading system of the Exchange. The report shall show for each trade (i) the identity of each Clearing Participant and/or Network Participant, (ii) whether bought or sold, (iii) quantity, (iv) delivery month, (v) the price, (vi) whether for house, Customer, or non- Customer account, and (vii) such other information as may be required by FreightTrust Clearing. (B). If FreightTrust Clearing determines that any trade report submitted pursuant to this Rule 401 contains a material error or is otherwise not eligible for clearing by FreightTrust Clearing, FreightTrust Clearing may reject such trade and notify the Exchange of such rejection, setting forth the basis of such objection. 402. Clearance and Substitution. (a) The submission of a Contract (Smart Contract or a Normal Contract) to FreightTrust Clearing by or on behalf of the buying and selling Clearing Participants shall constitute a request, by such Clearing Participants, for the clearing of such Contract by FreightTrust Clearing. Upon the acceptance thereof by FreightTrust Clearing, which ordinarily shall be deemed to occur upon the receipt of matched trade data from the Exchange, the Contract shall be novated and FreightTrust Clearing shall be substituted as, and assume the position of, seller to the Clearing Participant buying such Contract and buyer from the Clearing Participant selling such Contract. Upon such substitution, such buying and selling Clearing Participants shall be released from their obligations to each other, and FreightTrust Clearing shall be deemed to have succeeded to all the rights, and to have assumed all the Obligations, of the Clearing Participants that were party to such Contract, in each case as provided in the Rules. (b) Where an FCM Clearing Participant and/or Network Participant acts to clear a Contract made for the account of a Customer, the FCM Clearing Participant becomes obligated to FreightTrust Clearing, and FreightTrust Clearing becomes obligated to the FCM Clearing Participant, with respect to such Contract in the same manner and to the same extent as if the Contract were for the account of the FCM Clearing Participant. \u00a9 Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), a trade shall not be accepted for clearing, and FreightTrust Clearing shall not be substituted for a given Contract, unless the Margin for such Contract is made available to FreightTrust Clearing, by or for both Clearing Participants, pursuant to Rule 403. 403. Margin (a) Each Network and Clearing Participant SHALL deposit funds or Collateral in the form of the applicable quantity of the deliverable underlying commodity and/or deliverable asset required to fully collateralize orders pursuant to the contract specifications contained in the Rulebook, including payment of premiums, payment in exchange for delivery or to fulfill delivery obligations, as applicable, prior to submission of such orders to the Exchange. Fund and Collateral transfers made by a Clearing Participant to the Clearinghouse or by the Clearinghouse to a Clearing Participant are irrevocable and unconditional when effected. The Clearing Participant shall be responsible for all fees associated with wires or transfers of Collateral to the Clearinghouse. (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of the Clearinghouse, Clearing Participants may deposit the following as Margin: ( 1 ) cash ; ( 2 ) the underlying commodity ; and ( 3 ) any other form of Collateral deemed acceptable by the Risk Management Committee upon the Risk Management Committee \u2019 s approval of such Collateral as communicated through Clearinghouse notices . The Clearinghouse will value margin Collateral as it deems appropriate . \u00a9 Funds and Collateral must be and remain unencumbered. Except as otherwise provided herein, each Clearing Participant posting funds or Collateral hereby grants to the Clearinghouse a first priority security interest in and unencumbered lien against any Margin, Contracts, positions and other funds, property and any other Collateral deposited with the Clearinghouse by the Clearing Participant, including without limitation such Clearing Participant\u2019s Member Property Accounts, the Customer Accounts of such Clearing Participant\u2019s Customers, and all securities entitlements held therein. A Clearing Participant shall execute any documents required by FreightTrust Clearing to create, perfect and enforce such lien. Each Clearing Participant hereby agrees that with respect to any funds or Collateral which is or may be credited to the Clearing Participant\u2019s Member Property Account or Customer Account, as applicable, the Clearinghouse shall have control pursuant to Section 9-106(a) and 8-106(e) of the UCC and a perfected security interest pursuant to Section 9-314(a) of the UCC. (d) FreightTrust Clearing may assign, pledge, repledge or otherwise create a lien on or security interest in, and enter into repurchase agreements involving, Margin, Contracts, positions and other funds, property and any other Collateral deposited with the Clearinghouse by the Clearing Participant, as permitted by CFTC Regulations, held in or for such Clearing Participant\u2019s Member Property Accounts or the Customer Accounts of such Clearing Participant\u2019s Customers to secure the repayment of funds that may be borrowed by FreightTrust Clearing. (e) Clearing Participant must transfer the funds and Collateral to the Clearinghouse which will hold funds and Collateral on behalf of the Clearing Participant. FreightTrust Clearing will credit to the Clearing Participant the funds and Collateral that such Clearing Participant deposits. Funds and Collateral shall be held by the Clearinghouse until a Clearing Participant submits a withdrawal notification, unless otherwise stipulated by these Rules. FreightTrust Clearing will not be responsible for any diminution in value of funds or Collateral that a Clearing Participant deposits with the Clearinghouse, except, in the case of cash, the diminution of value is as a direct result of investment activity of the Clearinghouse, such activity having been conducted in full compliance with CFTC Regulations. Any fluctuation in markets is the risk of each Clearing Participant. Any interest earned on Clearing Participant funds or Collateral may be retained by the Clearinghouse. (f) If a Clearing Participant is in Default, FreightTrust Clearing may foreclose on and sell any of the Margin deposited by such Clearing Participant without notice. (g) FreightTrust Clearing shall be empowered to invest and reinvest all or part of the funds constituting Margin. Such investments shall be for the account and risk of FreightTrust Clearing, and any income and gains on such investments and interest on such deposits shall belong to FreightTrust Clearing and may be withdrawn from the account holding the Margin and deposited with the general funds of FreightTrust Clearing. 404. Offset and Settlement. (a) Where, as the result of novation under Rule 402, a Clearing Participant has bought and sold a Contract on or subject to the Rules of the Exchange with the same expiration, or otherwise deemed equivalent by the Clearinghouse, the purchase and sale will be offset by FreightTrust Clearing through the timely submission of instructions by the Clearing Participant containing such information as FreightTrust Clearing may require in accordance with its procedures. A Clearing Participant shall be required to pay the loss or entitled to collect the profit, as the case may be, upon such offsetting transactions, and shall have no further rights or be under any further obligation with respect thereto. For purposes of this Rule 404, the first Contracts made shall be deemed the first Contracts offset. (b) Contracts made and designated by the Network or Clearing Participant as for the Network and/or Clearing Participant\u2019s Customer Account shall not be offset under this Rule 405 against Contracts designated by the Clearing Participant as for the Clearing Participant\u2019s own Member Property Account. 405. Approved Depository Institutions. A bank, trust company or other depository that meets such financial and other requirements of FreightTrust Clearing may be designated by FreightTrust Clearing as an Approved Depository Institution. 406. Statement of Trades and Contracts. FreightTrust Clearing shall in the manner and at the time that it determines from time to time make available to a Clearing Participant an accounting of trades and Contracts for each Business Day on which such Clearing Participant has trades to be cleared or Contracts open with FreightTrust Clearing. Any amounts the Clearing Participant has posted to FreightTrust Clearing under Rule 403 shall be indicated on this statement 409. Settlement Prices. As used in the Rules, the term \u201cSettlement Price\u201d means the settlement price for a Contract for which positions remain open, as determined, intra-day and at the close of regular trading hours, by the Exchange in accordance with its rules, except in the case of manifest error or where FreightTrust Clearing believes that such settlement price does not reasonably reflect the value or price of the Contract, in which case FreightTrust Clearing, using its best efforts to consult with the Exchange, shall determine the official Settlement Price; provided, that FreightTrust Clearing shall in such circumstances promptly notify the Exchange and Clearing Participants, and the reasons for that determination and the basis for the Settlement Price determined by FreightTrust Clearing shall be published in a notice to the Exchange and Clearing Participants. 410. Delivery After trading ceases for a Smart Contract and/or Normal Contract that is physically settled, the Clearinghouse shall transfer the underlying to the Account of the Clearing Participant that is required to accept delivery, from the Account of the Clearing Participant obligated to make delivery, such full collateralization having been transferred to the Clearinghouse\u2019s custody at the inception of the trade. Deliveries will occur on the Clearinghouse\u2019s books and records unless otherwise specified in the Exchange contract specifications. 411. Reporting. Network and Clearing Participants shall make such reports in respect of trades, Smart Contracts, Normal Contracts settlements and deliveries as may be as prescribed by FreightTrust Clearing. 412. Recieved Subject to the rates, classifications and rules that have been established by the Carrier and are available on request to the Shipper (Shipper defined in 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 13102(13)\u00a9), and to all applicable state and federal regulations. Shipper 1) warrants it has read all applicable contract(s) or Carrier\u2019s applicable tariff(s) and the limitation of liability provisions set forth therein; and 2) has actual knowledge of and accepts the applicable contract or tariff terms, including the limits on carrier liability. Carriers\u2019 tariff(s), including OD Rules 100, take precedence in the event of any terms or conditions conflicts. copyright \u00a9 2019 FreightTrust & Clearing Corporation.

Federal Bills of Lading Act The Federal Act governs bills of lading that are used in interstate or foreign commerce.

Between a location in: (i) Washington DC and another location in Washington DC; (ii) a US territory or possession and another location in the same territory or possession; (iii) a US state and a location in another US state; or (iv) a US state and a location in the same state through another US state or a foreign country.

UCC Article 7 Article 7 of the UCC governs bills of lading when the transaction or shipment relates to intrastate commerce. Article 7 of the UCC supplements, but is generally consistent with, the Federal Act. How Bills of Lading Are Used A bill of lading is an agreement between a consignor of goods and the carrier transporting the goods. The bill of lading serves as both: A receipt that provides the consignor with evidence of the goods' delivery to the carrier. A contract that states the terms and conditions under which the carrier agrees to transport the goods. The parties generally engaged in a transaction involving a bill of lading are: The shipper or consignor. The shipper or consignor is the party sending the goods. The carrier or bailee. The carrier (or bailee under the UCC) has possession of the goods and contracts to deliver them. The consignee. The consignee is the party to whom the goods are delivered. The carrier or its agent signs the bill of lading and issues it to the consignor. The consignor then typically sends the consignee or its agent the bill of lading through mail or another means of communication. Any kind of carrier can issue a bill of lading, regardless of the transportation method (whether by land, water, or air). The carrier issues the bill of lading to the consignor at either: The place of shipment [x]. The destination point [y]. Any other designated place that the consignor requests. The carrier then delivers the goods covered in the bill of lading to either: The order of a consignor or consignee, if the bill of lading is negotiable (for an explanation of negotiable bills of lading, see Order Bill of Lading). A specifically named consignee, if the bill of lading is nonnegotiable (for an explanation of nonnegotiable bills of lading, see Straight Bill of Lading).

Legacy Implementation Note (v1): Functional equivalence of possession is achieved when a reliable method is employed to establish control of that record by a person and to identify the person in control. The notion of control when used as a substitute for possession requires a reliable method for identifying the current party in control of a specific electronic record as the said notion typically focuses on the identity of the person entitled to enforce the rights embodied in the electronic transferable record. The method of identification may be accomplished through a closed system, or through an open system. Under the draft model law, the notion of original and uniqueness has been connected to control. Emphasis has been given to reliably ensure that the claim may be presented to the debtor only once. Documents capable for version 2 of protocol (legal parity is version 2, functional equivalence is version 1 or \"legacy\") An indicative list of transferable documents or instruments includes: bills of exchange, cheques, promissory notes, consignment notes, bills of lading, warehouse receipts, cargo insurance certificates and air waybills. Negotiable Bills of Lading A common carrier issuing a negotiable bill of lading has a lien on the goods covered by the bill for\u2013 (1) charges for storage, transportation, and delivery (including demurrage and terminal charges), and expenses necessary to preserve the goods or incidental to transporting the goods after the date of the bill; and (2) other charges for which the bill expressly specifies a lien is claimed to the extent the charges are allowed by law and the agreement between the consignor and carrier.

Replicate the function of paper bills, including a party\u2019s ability to issue, indorse, recut or surrender the e-bill; c. Replicate the physical transfer of paper bills and, whilst all parties can view an e-bill (in copy form), the trading platform restricts access and indorsement to the current lawful holder (by way of fob and access code) as the e-bills securely move from one party to the next; and d. Can be converted into paper bills, allowing them to be finally traded with parties which have not signed up to the ETS platform. However, it is notable that paper bills cannot be converted into e-bills since none of the ETS would be prepared to investigate and effectively warrant the provenance of paper bills and the physical cargo they represent. Replacement of a transferable document or instrument with an electronic transferable record An electronic transferable record may replace a transferable document or instrument if a reliable method for the change of medium is used. For the change of medium to take effect, a statement indicating a change of medium shall be inserted in the electronic transferable record. Upon issuance of the electronic transferable record in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2, the transferable document or instrument shall be made inoperative and ceases to have any effect or validity. A change of medium in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not affect the rights and obligations of the parties.

Bills of Lading have 3 groups: Master, FTL and LTL LTL Rules of Use for the Standard Bill of Lading # source: VICS BOL Standard The guidelines to the Bill of Lading are designed so that the U.S. industry may benefit from a form that is consistent and understandable. The standard VICS BOL is intended for U.S. LTL and TL ground transport. It is particularly critical that all businesses using the form adhere to its design so that the supply chain may take advantage of these benefits. Listed below is additional detail regarding the use of the standard Bill of Lading. Adjustments to the VICS Bill of Lading can be made based on the following guidelines: The geographical placement of data and data descriptions must be kept intact according to this standard. This is important to ensure that all parties within the supply chain will know where to locate the specific information they need. Each section or data description area may be modified to fit the supply chain business requirements as follows: Spacing Column width Row height Removal of the data lines in the Customer and Carrier Information sections when either the form or data is computer printed. When the form is loaded into a software program, all sections shall be clearly identified and the appropriate form lines and headings must be present. To support North America cross boarder ground shipments, the section headings can be modified to include bilingual wording. If cube information is being provided, the cube data column should be inserted between the Weight and Pallet/Slip column in the Customer Order Section. The following data must be 12-point Bold: a) Bill of Lading number c) Ship to Location number b) SCAC/Pro number d) Customer Order Number When printing processes do not allow for variances in point size and bolding, the above data must be displayed with adequate spacing and high quality printing to support ease of recognition and data entry by the carriers. The CID number shall be in 10-point and bolded. All other data input items may be in a 10-point or smaller (See Section I Page 3 & 4 on legal statements), no bolding. Printing: The standard Bill of Lading may be duplicated and printed in multiple part forms by any printing company or shipper. If the Supplement page is used, the best practice has been to print the Supplement page(s) first, then print the front Bill of Lading page with the Grand Totals last. The Bill of Lading page must then be placed in front of the Supplement page(s). Pagination: In general, each bill of lading (including any supplement pages) and attachments are considered separate documents. For example: a) BOL with 3 supplement pages: BOL = page 1, Supplement = pages 2, 3 and 4 b) Master BOL with 2 underlying BOL\u2019s; underlying BOL\u2019s with 2 supplement pages: Master BOL = page 1, First underlying BOL = page 1, supplement pages = 2, 3 Second underlying BOL = page 1, supplement pages =2, 3. c) BOL with an attachment (e.g., packing list and /or shipping manifest): BOL = page 1, attachment one = pages 1, 2\u2026\u200b, attachment two = pages 1, 2\u2026\u200b. IV. Rules of Use for the Standard Bill of Lading 14 The Bill of Lading is not to be used as a packing list; the packing list is to be on a separate document. In addition, the following items are not part of the Bill of Lading and shall not be included on the Bill of Lading. However, these documents are considered as potential attachments to the Bill of Lading. Packing List line item information. Shipping Manifest - The Shipping Manifest is a document generated by the shipper for a customer pertaining to store shipments that are shipped to a customer specified intermediate location (i.e., distribution center, consolidator) with the individual cartons marked for specific store locations. The manifest contains store level detail that typically includes store location numbers, store addresses, customer order numbers, number of cartons per order per store and weight/cube totals. Hazardous Item List (See Section VII. Hazardous Materials Regulations for instructions) See Appendix E for recommended format, detailed data content explanation and examples. The Canadian PARS sticker for customs belongs on the freight invoice, not on the Bill of Lading. The information conveyed through EDI (e.g. EDI 856, 204, 211, 214) shall be consistent with the information on the paper Bill of Lading. This in no way implies that all information conveyed through any one EDI document will map one-to- one to the paper Bill of Lading. When using the Supplement Page to list customer order number and commodity information, state \u201cSee attached Bill of Lading Supplement\u201d in the body of the first page and begin listing the information on the supplement page. Only the grand total of the cartons and weight for the shipment will be detailed on the first page. No Bill of Lading information shall be placed on the back of the Bill of Lading page.

The underlying Bill of Lading numbers shall be referenced in the Special Instructions field on the Master Bill of Lading. The Master Bill of Lading number shall be referenced in the Special Instructions field on the underlying Bills of Lading. The development of the Supplement Page to the Bill of Lading eliminates the use of a Master Bill of Lading for the purpose of needing more lines to fit all the information on one page (see section V) t The Master Bill of Lading shall not be used for this purpose. Often a Master Bill of Lading, with underlying Bills of Lading attached, is used in conjunction with the 856 Ship Notice Manifest and the 214 Carrier Shipment Status EDI transaction sets. In this case, the Master Bill of Lading number is the number that is transmitted on the EDI transaction sets representing that shipment. Do not transmit the underlying Bill of Lading numbers as that causes confusion as to which Bill of Lading number is the one to be used. The use of a Master Bill of Lading is a complex aspect of shipping that may be better shown by example.","title":"Legal Parity"},{"location":"rulebook/legal-parity/#_1","text":"/* Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 2.5 * https://spdx.org/licenses/CC-BY-NC-ND-2.5.html * \u00a9 2020 FreightTrust and Clearing Corporation */ (a)Negotiable Bills.\u2014 (1) A bill of lading is negotiable if the bill\u2014 (A) states that the goods are to be delivered to the order of a consignee; and (B) does not contain on its face an agreement with the shipper that the bill is not negotiable.

Legacy Implementation Note (v1): Functional equivalence of possession is achieved when a reliable method is employed to establish control of that record by a person and to identify the person in control. The notion of control when used as a substitute for possession requires a reliable method for identifying the current party in control of a specific electronic record as the said notion typically focuses on the identity of the person entitled to enforce the rights embodied in the electronic transferable record. The method of identification may be accomplished through a closed system, or through an open system. Under the draft model law, the notion of original and uniqueness has been connected to control. Emphasis has been given to reliably ensure that the claim may be presented to the debtor only once. Documents capable for version 2 of protocol (legal parity is version 2, functional equivalence is version 1 or \"legacy\") An indicative list of transferable documents or instruments includes: bills of exchange, cheques, promissory notes, consignment notes, bills of lading, warehouse receipts, cargo insurance certificates and air waybills.","title":""},{"location":"rulebook/legal-parity/#negotiable-bills-of-lading","text":"A common carrier issuing a negotiable bill of lading has a lien on the goods covered by the bill for\u2013 (1) charges for storage, transportation, and delivery (including demurrage and terminal charges), and expenses necessary to preserve the goods or incidental to transporting the goods after the date of the bill; and (2) other charges for which the bill expressly specifies a lien is claimed to the extent the charges are allowed by law and the agreement between the consignor and carrier.

The Board, Risk Management Committee, or any Exchange Committee may summarily suspend any Clearing Participant (i) if the Clearing Participant is in Default, (ii) upon the discovery of a materially false or misleading representation or warranty made by the Clearing Participant to FreightTrust Clearing under or in connection with any agreement between FreightTrust Clearing and the Clearing Participant, (iii) if a breach by the Clearing Participant of the Rules or any of the terms or provisions of any agreement between FreightTrust Clearing and the Clearing Participant is not remedied promptly after notice from FreightTrust Clearing, (iv) in the event of a material violation of the Rules of the Exchange or of the Clearinghouse, or (v) if the Board or the Risk Management Committee determines that suspension is necessary for the protection of FreightTrust Clearing, other Clearing Participants, or the general public (whether or not such Clearing Participant continues to meet the required minimum financial requirements pursuant to the Rules). (B). Notice of Suspension to Network and Clearing Participants Upon the suspension of a Clearing Participant, FreightTrust Clearing shall as soon as possible notify all Clearing Participants of the suspension. Such notice shall state to the extent practicable in general terms how pending transactions, open positions and other pending matters will be affected and what steps are to be taken in connection therewith. \u00a9. Pending Transactions Notwithstanding any other provision of the Rules, FreightTrust Clearing shall have no obligation to accept any transaction of a suspended Network and/or Clearing Participant that was effected after the time at which the Clearing Participant was suspended. In the event a transaction of a suspended Clearing Participant is rejected by FreightTrust Clearing, FreightTrust Clearing shall provide notice of such rejection to the other party thereto and such transaction shall be closed by the other party thereto in accordance with the rules of the Exchange. (D). Open Positions * FreightTrust Clearing shall have the right to cause open positions in Contracts in any of the accounts of a suspended Clearing Participant: (i) To be closed in such manner as deemed practicable by FreightTrust Clearing, in its sole discretion; (ii) To be transferred to the account of one or more other Clearing Participants; (iii) To be offset against each other and, to the extent of any remaining imbalance, against the Contracts of other Clearing Participants; or (iv) To be settled at the Settlement Price for such Contracts, or at such other price or prices as FreightTrust Clearing may deem fair and reasonable under the circumstances, in which event FreightTrust Clearing may cause Contracts in the accounts of other Clearing Participants to be settled at such price or prices; (v) Or take any other action with respect to open positions it deems in the best interest of the Clearinghouse or the Clearing Participants. In connection with any action undertaken by FreightTrust Clearing pursuant to subparagraphs (i) through (iv) above, FreightTrust Clearing shall have the right to apply the Margin of the applicable Clearing Participant and any other assets of such Clearing Participant held by, pledged to or otherwise available to FreightTrust Clearing, including any guarantee issued pursuant to these Rules, to discharge the Obligations of such Clearing Participant to FreightTrust Clearing (including any costs and expenses associated with the liquidation, transfer or management of Contracts held in or for the accounts of such Network and/or Clearing Participant, and any fees, assessments or fines imposed by FreightTrust Clearing on such Clearing Participant). FreightTrust Clearing may delegate to specified Officers or agents of FreightTrust Clearing the authority to determine, within such guidelines, if any, as FreightTrust Clearing shall prescribe, the nature and timing of transactions of the type described in subparagraph (i). Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this paragraph (d), if FreightTrust Clearing shall determine, taking into account the size and nature of a suspended Clearing Participant\u2019s positions, market conditions prevailing at the time, the potential market effects of liquidating transactions that might be directed by FreightTrust Clearing, and such other circumstances as FreightTrust Clearing deems relevant, that the closing out of some or all of the suspended Network and/or Clearing Participant\u2019s positions would not be in the best interests of FreightTrust Clearing, other Clearing Participants, or the general public, such positions need not be closed out. (E). Protective Action If FreightTrust Clearing (i) is unable, for any reason, to close out in a prompt and orderly manner any positions or to convert to cash any Margin deposits of a suspended Network and/or Clearing Participant, or (ii) elects pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Rule not to close out any such positions, FreightTrust Clearing may authorize the execution of hedging transactions from time to time for the account of FreightTrust Clearing, solely for the purpose of reducing the risk to FreightTrust Clearing resulting from the continued maintenance of such positions or the continued holding of such Margin deposits. FreightTrust Clearing may delegate to specified Officers or agents of FreightTrust Clearing the authority to determine, within such guidelines, if any, as FreightTrust Clearing shall prescribe, the nature and timing of such hedging transactions. (F). Reimbursement of Costs and Expenses Any costs or expenses, including losses, sustained by FreightTrust Clearing in connection with transactions effected for its account pursuant to this Rule shall be charged to the suspended Clearing Participant, and any gains realized on such transactions shall be credited to such Clearing Participant; provided, however, that costs, expenses, and gains allocable to the hedging of positions in a Customer Account shall be charged or credited, as the case may be, to the Customer Account, and only the excess, if any, of such costs and expenses over the funds available in that account shall be charged to the Clearing Participant. Reasonable allocations of costs, expenses, and gains among accounts made by FreightTrust Clearing for the purpose of implementing the proviso to the preceding sentence shall be binding on the Clearing Participant and any persons claiming through the Clearing Participant and their respective successors and assigns. 602. Right of Appeal. A Clearing Participant suspended pursuant to Rule 601 shall be entitled, upon request within five Business Days after the date of its suspension, to a written statement of the grounds for its suspension and shall have the right to appeal its suspension in accordance with the following procedure: ( A ).

The appellant shall be notified in writing of the decision of the Board ; and if the decision shall have been to affirm or modify the suspension , the appellant shall be given a written statement of the grounds therefor . ( D ). The filing of an appeal pursuant to this Rule shall not impair the validity or stay the effect of the suspension appealed from . The reversal or modification of a suspension shall not invalidate any acts of FreightTrust Clearing taken pursuant to such suspension prior to such reversal or modification , and the rights of any person which may arise out of any such acts shall not be affected by such reversal or modification . ( E ). A record shall be kept of any hearing held pursuant hereto .

The Board, Risk Management Committee, or any Exchange Committee may summarily suspend any Clearing Participant (i) if the Clearing Participant is in Default, (ii) upon the discovery of a materially false or misleading representation or warranty made by the Clearing Participant to FreightTrust Clearing under or in connection with any agreement between FreightTrust Clearing and the Clearing Participant, (iii) if a breach by the Clearing Participant of the Rules or any of the terms or provisions of any agreement between FreightTrust Clearing and the Clearing Participant is not remedied promptly after notice from FreightTrust Clearing, (iv) in the event of a material violation of the Rules of the Exchange or of the Clearinghouse, or (v) if the Board or the Risk Management Committee determines that suspension is necessary for the protection of FreightTrust Clearing, other Clearing Participants, or the general public (whether or not such Clearing Participant continues to meet the required minimum financial requirements pursuant to the Rules). (B). Notice of Suspension to Network and Clearing Participants Upon the suspension of a Clearing Participant, FreightTrust Clearing shall as soon as possible notify all Clearing Participants of the suspension. Such notice shall state to the extent practicable in general terms how pending transactions, open positions and other pending matters will be affected and what steps are to be taken in connection therewith. \u00a9. Pending Transactions Notwithstanding any other provision of the Rules, FreightTrust Clearing shall have no obligation to accept any transaction of a suspended Network and/or Clearing Participant that was effected after the time at which the Clearing Participant was suspended. In the event a transaction of a suspended Clearing Participant is rejected by FreightTrust Clearing, FreightTrust Clearing shall provide notice of such rejection to the other party thereto and such transaction shall be closed by the other party thereto in accordance with the rules of the Exchange. (D). Open Positions * FreightTrust Clearing shall have the right to cause open positions in Contracts in any of the accounts of a suspended Clearing Participant: (i) To be closed in such manner as deemed practicable by FreightTrust Clearing, in its sole discretion; (ii) To be transferred to the account of one or more other Clearing Participants; (iii) To be offset against each other and, to the extent of any remaining imbalance, against the Contracts of other Clearing Participants; or (iv) To be settled at the Settlement Price for such Contracts, or at such other price or prices as FreightTrust Clearing may deem fair and reasonable under the circumstances, in which event FreightTrust Clearing may cause Contracts in the accounts of other Clearing Participants to be settled at such price or prices; (v) Or take any other action with respect to open positions it deems in the best interest of the Clearinghouse or the Clearing Participants. In connection with any action undertaken by FreightTrust Clearing pursuant to subparagraphs (i) through (iv) above, FreightTrust Clearing shall have the right to apply the Margin of the applicable Clearing Participant and any other assets of such Clearing Participant held by, pledged to or otherwise available to FreightTrust Clearing, including any guarantee issued pursuant to these Rules, to discharge the Obligations of such Clearing Participant to FreightTrust Clearing (including any costs and expenses associated with the liquidation, transfer or management of Contracts held in or for the accounts of such Network and/or Clearing Participant, and any fees, assessments or fines imposed by FreightTrust Clearing on such Clearing Participant). FreightTrust Clearing may delegate to specified Officers or agents of FreightTrust Clearing the authority to determine, within such guidelines, if any, as FreightTrust Clearing shall prescribe, the nature and timing of transactions of the type described in subparagraph (i). Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this paragraph (d), if FreightTrust Clearing shall determine, taking into account the size and nature of a suspended Clearing Participant\u2019s positions, market conditions prevailing at the time, the potential market effects of liquidating transactions that might be directed by FreightTrust Clearing, and such other circumstances as FreightTrust Clearing deems relevant, that the closing out of some or all of the suspended Network and/or Clearing Participant\u2019s positions would not be in the best interests of FreightTrust Clearing, other Clearing Participants, or the general public, such positions need not be closed out. (E). Protective Action If FreightTrust Clearing (i) is unable, for any reason, to close out in a prompt and orderly manner any positions or to convert to cash any Margin deposits of a suspended Network and/or Clearing Participant, or (ii) elects pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Rule not to close out any such positions, FreightTrust Clearing may authorize the execution of hedging transactions from time to time for the account of FreightTrust Clearing, solely for the purpose of reducing the risk to FreightTrust Clearing resulting from the continued maintenance of such positions or the continued holding of such Margin deposits. FreightTrust Clearing may delegate to specified Officers or agents of FreightTrust Clearing the authority to determine, within such guidelines, if any, as FreightTrust Clearing shall prescribe, the nature and timing of such hedging transactions. (F). Reimbursement of Costs and Expenses Any costs or expenses, including losses, sustained by FreightTrust Clearing in connection with transactions effected for its account pursuant to this Rule shall be charged to the suspended Clearing Participant, and any gains realized on such transactions shall be credited to such Clearing Participant; provided, however, that costs, expenses, and gains allocable to the hedging of positions in a Customer Account shall be charged or credited, as the case may be, to the Customer Account, and only the excess, if any, of such costs and expenses over the funds available in that account shall be charged to the Clearing Participant. Reasonable allocations of costs, expenses, and gains among accounts made by FreightTrust Clearing for the purpose of implementing the proviso to the preceding sentence shall be binding on the Clearing Participant and any persons claiming through the Clearing Participant and their respective successors and assigns.","title":"General"},{"location":"rulebook/suspension/#602-right-of-appeal","text":"A Clearing Participant suspended pursuant to Rule 601 shall be entitled, upon request within five Business Days after the date of its suspension, to a written statement of the grounds for its suspension and shall have the right to appeal its suspension in accordance with the following procedure: ( A ).

The Application Identifiers (AI\u2019s) are not part of the actual data. The AI is only used at the point of scanning to determine data type and/or size for application system processing. If you choose to implement the bar coding of the BOL number and/or SCAC and Pro# for a carrier, be sure that the carrier is aware of the above requirements. The standard VICS BOL is intended for U.S. LTL and TL ground transport. It is particularly critical that all businesses using the form adhere to its design so that the supply chain may take advantage of these benefits. Listed below is additional detail regarding the use of the standard Bill of Lading. Adjustments Adjustments to the VICS Bill of Lading can be made based on the following guidelines: The geographical placement of data and data descriptions must be kept intact according to this standard. This is important to ensure that all parties within the supply chain will know where to locate the specific information they need. Each section or data description area may be modified to fit the supply chain business requirements as follows: Spacing Column width Row height Removal of the data lines in the Customer and Carrier Information sections when either the form or data is computer printed. When the form is loaded into a software program, all sections shall be clearly identified and the appropriate form lines and headings must be present. To support North America cross boarder ground shipments, the section headings can be modified to include bilingual wording. If cube information is being provided, the cube data column should be inserted between the Weight and Pallet/Slip column in the Customer Order Section. The following data must be 12-point Bold: a) Bill of Lading number c) Ship to Location number b) SCAC/Pro number d) Customer Order Number When printing processes do not allow for variances in point size and bolding, the above data must be displayed with adequate spacing and high quality printing to support ease of recognition and data entry by the carriers. The CID number shall be in 10-point and bolded. All other data input items may be in a 10-point or smaller (See Section I Page 3 & 4 on legal statements), no bolding. 2. Printing: The standard Bill of Lading may be duplicated and printed in multiple part forms by any printing company or shipper. If the Supplement page is used, the best practice has been to print the Supplement page(s) first, then print the front Bill of Lading page with the Grand Totals last. The Bill of Lading page must then be placed in front of the Supplement page(s). 3. Pagination: In general, each bill of lading (including any supplement pages) and attachments are considered separate documents. For example: a) BOL with 3 supplement pages: BOL = page 1, Supplement = pages 2, 3 and 4 b) Master BOL with 2 underlying BOL\u2019s; underlying BOL\u2019s with 2 supplement pages: Master BOL = page 1, First underlying BOL = page 1, supplement pages = 2, 3 Second underlying BOL = page 1, supplement pages =2, 3. c) BOL with an attachment (e.g., packing list and /or shipping manifest): BOL = page 1, attachment one = pages 1, 2\u2026\u200b, attachment two = pages 1, 2\u2026\u200b. 4. Rules of Use for the Standard Bill of Lading The Bill of Lading is not to be used as a packing list; the packing list is to be on a separate document. In addition, the following items are not part of the Bill of Lading and shall not be included on the Bill of Lading. However, these documents are considered as potential attachments to the Bill of Lading. Packing List line item information. Shipping Manifest - The Shipping Manifest is a document generated by the shipper for a customer pertaining to store shipments that are shipped to a customer specified intermediate location (i.e., distribution center, consolidator) with the individual cartons marked for specific store locations. The manifest contains store level detail that typically includes store location numbers, store addresses, customer order numbers, number of cartons per order per store and weight/cube totals. Hazardous Item List (See Section VII. Hazardous Materials Regulations for instructions) See Appendix E for recommended format, detailed data content explanation and examples. The Canadian PARS sticker for customs belongs on the freight invoice, not on the Bill of Lading. The information conveyed through EDI (e.g. EDI 856, 204, 211, 214) shall be consistent with the information on the paper Bill of Lading. This in no way implies that all information conveyed through any one EDI document will map one-to- one to the paper Bill of Lading. When using the Supplement Page to list customer order number and commodity information, state \u201cSee attached Bill of Lading Supplement\u201d in the body of the first page and begin listing the information on the supplement page. Only the grand total of the cartons and weight for the shipment will be detailed on the first page. No Bill of Lading information shall be placed on the back of the Bill of Lading page. This area is reserved for the terms and conditions of the contract on the preprinted forms. Additional printing considerations and options. A. Data tags can be used in the Customer Order Information Section to identify multiple data elements that may be required by the consignee Use of Master Bill of Lading A Master Bill of Lading is created for three shipment scenarios: Consolidation shipments Invoice per Bill of Lading per customer order Truckload shipments with multiple stops For these scenarios, the purpose of the Master Bill of Lading is to tie the underlying Bills of Lading together into one shipment for freight rating and billing purposes. The standard Bill of Lading is used as a Master Bill of Lading by checking the \u201cMaster Bill of Lading\u201d indicator box. The underlying Bill of Lading numbers shall be referenced in the Special Instructions field on the Master Bill of Lading. The Master Bill of Lading number shall be referenced in the Special Instructions field on the underlying Bills of Lading. The development of the Supplement Page to the Bill of Lading eliminates the use of a Master Bill of Lading for the purpose of needing more lines to fit all the information on one page (see section V) The Master Bill of Lading shall not be used for this purpose. Often a Master Bill of Lading, with underlying Bills of Lading attached, is used in conjunction with the 856 Ship Notice Manifest and the 214 Carrier Shipment Status EDI transaction sets. In this case, the Master Bill of Lading number is the number that is transmitted on the EDI transaction sets representing that shipment. Do not transmit the underlying Bill of Lading numbers as that causes confusion as to which Bill of Lading number is the one to be used. The use of a Master Bill of Lading is a complex aspect of shipping that may be better shown by example.","title":"Bill of Lading Rules"},{"location":"supply-chain/bill-of-lading-rules/#_1","text":"Bill of Lading Rules :barcode: EAN.UCC-128. :base: VICS :version: 19.05 NOTICE: The bar code symbology used must be the EAN.UCC-128.

[2] CUSTOMS POWER OF ATTORNEY A customs power of attorney gives the customs broker legal authority to act as the importer\u2019s agent related to customs business, including: Preparing and filing documents with CBP. Classifying and providing values for imported goods. Paying tariffs, duties, and other charges that CBP collects on imports. The power of attorney recites the specific activities the customs broker is authorized to conduct on the importer\u2019s behalf, which should be consistent with the services set out in this agreement. CBP regulations contain a sample general power of attorney (19 C.F.R. \u00a7 141.32), but the CBP form is unlimited and may authorize the customs broker to do more than the importer needs or wants it to do. [4] FEES AND DISBURSEMENTS This provision favors the importer, but the customs broker may insist on including language: Allowing it to adjust fees unilaterally if its rates generally change. Stating that the customs broker is not obligated to advance any funds on the importer\u2019s behalf and instead that the importer must prepay any anticipated or required disbursements. [5] INVOICING AND PAYMENT This Standard Document contemplates an ongoing relationship between the importer and the customs broker and calls for regular (typically monthly) invoicing and payment. For importers desiring infrequent or one-off customs brokerage services, an ad hoc invoicing procedure, with the customs broker issuing its invoice on completion of the services, may be more suitable. The importer should include the bracketed term \"undisputed\" in the second sentence to allow it to withhold payment of disputed charges. The customs broker should try to exclude the term. For information about payment terms, see Standard Clause, General Contract Clauses: Payment Terms. [10] SECURITY The Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (CTPAT) is a program established by CBP after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. It allows importers committing to specified supply chain security practices to receive certain benefits from CBP, including: Fewer CBP inspections. Shorter wait times for inspections at the borders. The importer should include this optional provision if it is a CTPAT member, because it must ensure that its supply chain business partners, including its customs brokers, either: Are CTPAT members. Have processes in place to ensure compliance with the CBP\u2019s published minimum security requirements. An importer that is not a CTPAT member may include this provision as well if it wishes. In addition to including Section 10 in this in this agreement, the importer should also obtain back-up documents from the broker confirming these representations and warranties. [12] ASSIGNMENT; SUCCESSORS Anti-assignment clauses are included in agreements to restrict the parties' ability to assign their rights under the agreement, often by requiring the non-assigning party\u2019s prior written consent. Include the bracketed language at the end of the first sentence if a party wants to ensure the other party cannot withhold, condition, or delay its consent unreasonably. Assignment clauses also often deal with the parties' ability to delegate their obligations. The second sentence is included to render any assignment in violation of the section ineffective. Without this sentence, the non-assigning party may have only a breach of contract claim, but the assignment to a third party may remain effective. [13] INDEMNIFICATION This provision favors the importer by requiring the customs broker to indemnify it against claims arising from the customs broker\u2019s breach of the agreement or negligence. The customs broker should try to negotiate a reciprocal indemnification from the importer for claims it may face arising from: Inaccurate information the importer provides (see Section 6). Other claims, losses, and liabilities relating to the import or export of the importer\u2019s goods. Other indemnities may be included in an accompanying transportation or freight forwarding agreement.","title":"Customs Brokers"},{"location":"supply-chain/customs-broker-power-of-attorney/#_1","text":"@title : Customs Broker Agreement @version : 19.25 @copyright : CC - BY - NC - ND - 2.5 @notice : U .

For more information about protests, see Practice Note, Importing Goods into the US: Overview: Challenging CBP Decisions.

Clearing Corporation 1. Applicability. ${NAME OF CARRIER} (\"Carrier\") shall provide transportation, handling, delivery, and related services (the \"Services\") for the goods described on the face side hereof (the \"Goods\") on behalf of the shipper named on the face side hereof (\"Shipper\"). As part of the Services, Carrier shall deliver the Goods only to the consignee named on the face side hereof (\"Consignee\"). Carrier shall provide the Services pursuant to these terms and conditions, together with the quotations, terms, and conditions contained on the face side of this document (collectively, this \"Bill of Lading\"). 2. Liability of Carrier. (a) Carrier or the party in possession of the Goods shall be liable as at common law for any loss or damage to the Goods, except as provided below. (b) Carrier shall not be liable for any loss of or damage to the Goods or for any delay caused by an Act of God, public enemy, the authority of law, or the act or default of Shipper. [Except in the case of the negligence of Carrier or the party in possession of the Goods,] Carrier or the party in possession of the Goods shall not be liable for loss, damage, or delay which results: (i) when the Goods are stopped and held in transit on the request of Shipper or other party entitled to make such request; (ii) from faulty or impassable highway, or by lack of capacity of a highway bridge or ferry; (iii) from a defect or vice in the Goods, or (iv) from riots or strikes. Carrier or the party in possession of the Goods shall have the burden to prove that it has not acted negligently. 3. Transportation Schedule. Unless arranged or agreed upon, in writing, prior to shipment, Carrier is not required to transport a shipment by a particular schedule or by a particular date or time, but is responsible to transport the Goods with reasonable dispatch. In case of physical necessity, Carrier may forward a shipment via another carrier. 4. Claims. Carrier shall not be liable if a claim is not filed or a suit is not instituted thereon in accordance with the following provisions: (a) Claims for loss, damage, or delay must be filed in writing with any participating carrier having sufficient information to identify the shipment. ( b ) Claims for loss or damage must be filed within nine months after the delivery of the Goods ( or , in the case of export traffic , within nine months after delivery at the port of export ), except that claims for failure to make delivery must be filed within nine months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed . ( c ) Suits for loss , damage , injury , or delay shall be instituted against Carrier no later than two years and one day from the day when written notice is given by Carrier to the claimant that Carrier has disallowed the claim or any part or parts of the claim specified in the notice . ( d ) Carrier will have the full benefit of any insurance policies or contracts claimant has in effect on the Goods ; provided that Carrier receiving the benefit of such insurance must reimburse the claimant for the premium paid on the insurance policy or contract . 5. Goods not Delivered. (a) If Consignee refuses the shipment tendered for delivery by Carrier or if Carrier is unable to deliver the Goods, because of fault or mistake of Shipper or Consignee, Carrier's liability shall then become that of a warehouseman. Carrier shall promptly attempt to provide notice, by telephonic or electronic communication as provided on the face of this Bill of Lading, if so indicated, to Shipper or the party, if any, designated to receive notice on this Bill of Lading. Storage charges, based on Carrier's tariff, shall start no sooner than the next business day following the attempted notification. Storage may be, at Carrier's option, in any location that provides reasonable protection against loss or damage. Carrier may place the shipment in public storage at Shipper's expense and without liability to the Carrier. (b) If Carrier does not receive disposition instructions within 48 hours of the time of Carrier\u2019s attempted first notification, Carrier will make a good faith effort to issue a second and final confirmed notification. Such notice shall advise that if Carrier does not receive disposition instructions within 10 days of that notification, Carrier may offer the Goods for sale at a public auction and Carrier has the right to offer the Goods for sale. \u00a9 The amount of sale will be applied to Carrier\u2019s invoice for transportation, storage, and other lawful charges. Shipper shall be responsible for the balance of charges not covered by the sale of the Goods. If there is a balance remaining after all charges and expenses are paid, such balance will be paid to the owner of the Goods sold hereunder, upon claim and proof of ownership. (d) Where Carrier has attempted in good faith to follow the procedure set forth in subsections 4(a), (b) and \u00a9 above to dispose of the Goods and has been unable to do so, Carrier may, at its option, sell the Goods under such circumstances and in such manner as may be authorized by law. (e) When the Goods consist of perishable goods that cannot be delivered and disposition directions are not received by Carrier within a reasonable time, Carrier may sell the Goods at private or public sale. (f) Where Carrier is directed by Shipper or Consignee to unload or deliver Goods at a particular location where Shipper, Consignee, or the agent of either, is not regularly located, Carrier shall have no liability for the Goods after unloading or delivery at such location. SEE NOTE [2] 6. Limitations on Carrier\u2019s Liability. In all cases not prohibited by law, where a lower value than the actual value of the Goods has been stated in writing by Shipper or has been agreed upon by Shipper in writing as the released value of the Goods as determined by the classification or tariffs upon which the rate is based, such lower value plus freight charges if paid shall be the maximum amount of Carrier\u2019s liability for loss or damage, whether or not such loss or damage occurs from Carrier\u2019s negligence. 7. Freight Charges. (a) Shipper or Consignee shall be liable for the freight and other lawful charges accruing on the shipment, as billed or corrected, except that collect shipments may move without recourse to Shipper when Shipper so stipulates by signature or endorsement in the space provided on the face of this Bill of Lading. Nevertheless, Shipper shall remain liable for transportation charges where there has been an erroneous determination of the freight charges assessed, based upon incomplete or incorrect information provided by Shipper. (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) above, Consignee\u2019s liability for payment of additional charges that may be found to be due after delivery shall be as specified by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13706(a), except that Consignee need not provide the specified written notice to the delivering carrier if Consignee is a for-hire carrier. \u00a9 Nothing in this Bill of Lading shall limit the right of Carrier to require the prepayment or guarantee of Carrier\u2019s charges at the time of shipment or prior to delivery. If the description of the Goods or other information on this Bill of Lading is found to be incorrect or incomplete, the freight charges that are due will be based upon the Goods actually shipped. SEE NOTE [3] 8. Items of Extraordinary Value. Carrier will not be required to carry or be liable in any way for any documents, coin money, or articles of extraordinary value not specifically rated in the published classification or tariffs unless a special agreement to do so and a stipulated value of the articles are indorsed on the face side of this Bill of Lading. SEE NOTE [4] 9. Explosives, Dangerous, or Hazardous Goods. If Shipper ships explosives, dangerous, or hazardous goods without previous full written disclosure to Carrier of their nature, Shipper shall be liable for and indemnify Carrier against all loss or damage caused by those goods. Carrier may, but shall have no obligation to, warehouse such Goods at Shipper\u2019s risk and expense or destroy such Goods without liability to Carrier EXPLOSIVES, DANGEROUS, OR HAZARDOUS GOODS The transportation of dangerous goods may be subject to federal, state, or municipal law. Section 9 contains the shipper\u2019s indemnification for damages arising from the shipment of hazardous materials. The motor carrier tariff typically contains the carrier\u2019s disclaimer of liability, a more detailed shipper\u2019s indemnification, an obligation on the shipper to inform the carrier of the nature of the goods, and additional detailed provisions relating to the prohibited or restricted items, including: Animals. Asbestos. Explosives. Guns. Hazardous waste, including medical waste. 10. Substitute or Replacement Bill of Lading. If this Bill of Lading is issued on the order of Shipper or its agent, in exchange or in substitution for another bill of lading, Shipper\u2019s signature on the prior bill of lading as to the statement of value or otherwise, or election of common law or bill of lading liability will be considered a part of this Bill of Lading as fully as if the signature was made on this Bill of Lading. SEE NOTE [5] Transportation by Water. If all or any part of the Goods is carried by water over any part of the route, such water carriage shall be performed subject to the terms and provisions and limitations of liability specified by the \"Carriage of Goods by Sea Act\" and any other pertinent laws applicable to water carriers. SEE NOTE [6] Alterations and Additions. Any alteration, addition, or erasure in this Bill of Lading made without the special notation of Carrier will be without effect, and this Bill of Lading will be enforceable according to its original tenor. [1] LIABILITY OF CARRIER Sections 2(a) and (b) are consistent with the Carmack Amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act. The Carmack Amendment: Preempts any state law claims that a shipper may have against the carrier where the goods are damaged, lost, or untimely delivered in connection with the interstate shipment of goods. Provides the sole and exclusive remedy to shippers for loss or damage in interstate transit. Codified the common law rule that imposed near strict liability on freight carriers for damages to goods transported except where they can prove that the damages were caused by: an Act of God, such as a hurricane or earthquake. a public enemy, such as a person or entity that commits a terrorist act. an act or default of the shipper, such as the failure of the shipper to properly pack the goods. an act of a public authority, such as a quarantine or a road closure. an inherent vice or nature of the goods transported, such as spoilage of food, or spontaneous combustion of chemical cargo. (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14706.) Under the Carmack Amendment, a shipper that wants to hold a motor carrier liable for cargo damage must show: That the goods were in good condition when delivered to the carrier for shipment. That the goods were damaged when delivered (or lost before delivery). The amount of damages. (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14706.) Under the Carmack Amendment, motor carriers are liable for \u201cthe actual loss or injury to the property caused\u201d by the carrier, which typically is the difference between the market value of the property in the condition in which it should have arrived at its destination and its actual market Transportation Schedule. Unless arranged or agreed upon, in writing, prior to shipment, Carrier is not required to transport a shipment by a particular schedule or by a particular date or time, but is responsible to transport the Goods with reasonable dispatch. In case of physical necessity, Carrier may forward a shipment via another carrier. Claims. Carrier shall not be liable if a claim is not filed or a suit is not instituted thereon in accordance with the following provisions: (a) Claims for loss, damage, or delay must be filed in writing with any participating carrier having sufficient information to identify the shipment. (b) Claims for loss or damage must be filed within nine months after the delivery of the Goods (or, in the case of export traffic, within nine months after delivery at the port of export), except that claims for failure to make delivery must be filed within nine months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed. \u00a9 Suits for loss, damage, injury, or delay shall be instituted against Carrier no later than two years and one day from the day when written notice is given by Carrier to the claimant that Carrier has disallowed the claim or any part or parts of the claim specified in the notice. (d) Carrier will have the full benefit of any insurance policies or contracts claimant has in effect on the Goods; provided that Carrier receiving the benefit of such insurance must reimburse the claimant for the premium paid on the insurance policy or contract. Goods not Delivered. (a) If Consignee refuses the shipment tendered for delivery by Carrier or if Carrier is unable to deliver the Goods, because of fault or mistake of Shipper or Consignee, Carrier\u2019s liability shall then become that of a warehouseman. Carrier shall promptly attempt to provide notice, by telephonic or electronic communication as provided on the face of this Bill of Lading, if so indicated, to Shipper or the party, if any, designated to receive notice on this Bill of Lading. Storage charges, based on Carrier\u2019s tariff, shall start no sooner than the next business day following the attempted notification. Storage may be, at Carrier\u2019s option, in any location that provides reasonable protection against loss or damage. Carrier may place the shipment in public storage at Shipper\u2019s expense and without liability to the Carrier. value in the condition in which it did arrive. The Carmack Amendment, however, allows the carrier to limit its liability by including a limitation of liability provision, such as that provided in Section 6 (and supplemented by the extensive pro-carrier limitation of liability provisions typically found in the applicable motor carrier tariff). [2] GOODS NOT DELIVERED This provision provides contractual exceptions for liability of the carrier to deliver the goods that are similar to the exceptions provided a common carrier in the Federal Act, which covers: Delivery compelled by legal process. Goods sold lawfully to satisfy the carrier\u2019s lien. Goods that have not been claimed. Goods that are perishable or hazardous. (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 80111(d).) [3] FREIGHT CHARGES Under the Carmack Amendment, a carrier can adopt a tariff that is applied to shipping rates based on: The weight of the goods. The value of the goods. The mileage required to transport the goods. The amount of liability that the carrier is willing to incur for cargo loss or damage (see Section 6). The carrier typically supplements this provision with detailed provisions in its motor carrier tariff regarding: Payment terms, including collection fees, service charges, and other fees for delayed payment, non-payment, or returned check. The right to withhold delivery for delayed payment or non-payment. Freight fees that apply if the shipment originates from or is destined to specified high cost zip codes, such as the Borough of Manhattan. Any fuel surcharge imposed based on fuel reports of the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) or other criteria. Additional fees for special services, for example: (i) refrigerated transportation; and (ii) expedited or express service. Minimum charges for shipments, whether based on volume, density, or other criteria. Rates and procedures relating to \"collect on delivery (COD)\" and prepaid shipments. [4] ITEMS OF EXTRAORDINARY VALUE The transportation of valuables may be subject to federal, state, or municipal law. The motor carrier tariff typically contains the carrier\u2019s disclaimer of liability, the shipper\u2019s indemnification, and additional detailed provisions relating to the transportation of valuables, including: Antiques. Artwork. Currency. Jewelry. [5] SUBSTITUTE OR REPLACEMENT BILL OF LADING This provision establishes that in the situation where a substitute or replacement bill of lading is issued, for purposes of determining liability the shipper\u2019s declaration of value or election of liability on the original bill of lading continues to apply regarding the substitute bill of lading. [6] TRANSPORTATION BY WATER Special rules apply to water carriage. For example the Carmack Amendment provides that the liability of a water carrier is determined by its bill of lading and the law applicable to water transportation. Common carriers engaged in the transportation of property other than livestock and wild animals by water that are subject to the Interstate Commerce Act, must use bills of lading prescribed by 49 C.F.R. Section 1035.1(a). The Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA) is automatically enforced in international transportation of goods, but not in transportation of goods domestically unless the carrier agrees to be bound by the COGSA (46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7\u00a7 1300 to 1315 (1997)). The COGSA generally provides that a ship owner\u2019s liability is limited to $500 per shipping package and it stipulates a one-year time limit for filing suit against the Carrier. == NOTICES === Motor Carrier Tariff Federal law requires motor carriers to maintain a written or electronic copy of the \"rates, classifications, rules and practices\" that apply to its shipments (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13710). This bill of lading conforms to federal law and with industry practice by providing that the shipment is subject to the rates, classifications, and rules that have been established by the carrier in a separate motor carrier tariff. Carriers also maintain tariffs to set out a variety of pro-carrier risk allocation provisions that they want to enforce against all shippers. Some of these are discussed below in the drafting notes of the corresponding bill of lading provisions. Federal law requires applicable carriers to give the shipper a copy of the tariff on request (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13710(a)(1)). There is no requirement that a tariff be publicly accessible to be part of an enforceable contract between the shipper and the carrier. Many carriers, however, make their tariffs publicly available on their websites. Because the carrier drafts both the bill of lading and the motor carrier tariff, it should ensure that there is no conflict between the two documents. However, the carrier may want to specify in the tariff, that in the event of a conflict, the tariff controls. However, the shipper typically wishes the bill of lading to control because the bill of lading is the document it is signing (and may modify). In most cases, the carrier is likely to agree to specify in the bill of lading that in the event of a conflict the bill of lading controls over the tariff. Governing Law and Forum Bills of lading are generally governed by The Federal Bills of Lading Act (Federal Act) (49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 80101 - 80116), as well as Article 7 of the UCC, as enacted by the relevant state. Because both UCC Article 7 and court cases interpreting Article 7 can vary from state to state, counsel should always refer to the law of the specific jurisdiction governing the transaction. UCC Article 7 supplements, but is generally consistent with, the Federal Act. Generally motor carrier tariffs require the shipper to submit to exclusive arbitration, subject to any exception for arbitrability. Tariffs sometimes also make exceptions allowing claimants to bring small claims in small claims courts or other courts of limited jurisdiction.","title":"Non-Negotiable"},{"location":"supply-chain/non-negotiable-bol/#_1","text":"@title: Non-Negotiable Bill of Lading @param: ${ NAME OF CARRIER } @version: 19.20 @copyright: CC-BY-NC-ND-2.5 @author: FreightTrust & .

Provides the sole and exclusive remedy to shippers for loss or damage in interstate transit. Codified the common law rule that imposed near strict liability on freight carriers for damages to goods transported except where they can prove that the damages were caused by: an Act of God, such as a hurricane or earthquake. a public enemy, such as a person or entity that commits a terrorist act. an act or default of the shipper, such as the failure of the shipper to properly pack the goods. an act of a public authority, such as a quarantine or a road closure. an inherent vice or nature of the goods transported, such as spoilage of food, or spontaneous combustion of chemical cargo.

(b) Claims for loss or damage must be filed within nine months after the delivery of the Goods (or, in the case of export traffic, within nine months after delivery at the port of export), except that claims for failure to make delivery must be filed within nine months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed. \u00a9 Suits for loss, damage, injury, or delay shall be instituted against Carrier no later than two years and one day from the day when written notice is given by Carrier to the claimant that Carrier has disallowed the claim or any part or parts of the claim specified in the notice. (d) Carrier will have the full benefit of any insurance policies or contracts claimant has in effect on the Goods; provided that Carrier receiving the benefit of such insurance must reimburse the claimant for the premium paid on the insurance policy or contract.

(a) If Consignee refuses the shipment tendered for delivery by Carrier or if Carrier is unable to deliver the Goods, because of fault or mistake of Shipper or Consignee, Carrier\u2019s liability shall then become that of a warehouseman. Carrier shall promptly attempt to provide notice, by telephonic or electronic communication as provided on the face of this Bill of Lading, if so indicated, to Shipper or the party, if any, designated to receive notice on this Bill of Lading.

The Carmack Amendment, however, allows the carrier to limit its liability by including a limitation of liability provision, such as that provided in Section 6 (and supplemented by the extensive pro-carrier limitation of liability provisions typically found in the applicable motor carrier tariff). [2] GOODS NOT DELIVERED This provision provides contractual exceptions for liability of the carrier to deliver the goods that are similar to the exceptions provided a common carrier in the Federal Act, which covers: Delivery compelled by legal process. Goods sold lawfully to satisfy the carrier\u2019s lien. Goods that have not been claimed. Goods that are perishable or hazardous. (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 80111(d).) [3] FREIGHT CHARGES Under the Carmack Amendment, a carrier can adopt a tariff that is applied to shipping rates based on: The weight of the goods. The value of the goods. The mileage required to transport the goods. The amount of liability that the carrier is willing to incur for cargo loss or damage (see Section 6). The carrier typically supplements this provision with detailed provisions in its motor carrier tariff regarding: Payment terms, including collection fees, service charges, and other fees for delayed payment, non-payment, or returned check. The right to withhold delivery for delayed payment or non-payment. Freight fees that apply if the shipment originates from or is destined to specified high cost zip codes, such as the Borough of Manhattan.

Minimum charges for shipments, whether based on volume, density, or other criteria. Rates and procedures relating to \"collect on delivery (COD)\" and prepaid shipments. [4] ITEMS OF EXTRAORDINARY VALUE The transportation of valuables may be subject to federal, state, or municipal law.

Artwork. Currency. Jewelry. [5] SUBSTITUTE OR REPLACEMENT BILL OF LADING This provision establishes that in the situation where a substitute or replacement bill of lading is issued, for purposes of determining liability the shipper\u2019s declaration of value or election of liability on the original bill of lading continues to apply regarding the substitute bill of lading. [6] TRANSPORTATION BY WATER Special rules apply to water carriage. For example the Carmack Amendment provides that the liability of a water carrier is determined by its bill of lading and the law applicable to water transportation. Common carriers engaged in the transportation of property other than livestock and wild animals by water that are subject to the Interstate Commerce Act, must use bills of lading prescribed by 49 C.F.R. Section 1035.1(a). The Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA) is automatically enforced in international transportation of goods, but not in transportation of goods domestically unless the carrier agrees to be bound by the COGSA (46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7\u00a7 1300 to 1315 (1997)). The COGSA generally provides that a ship owner\u2019s liability is limited to $500 per shipping package and it stipulates a one-year time limit for filing suit against the Carrier. == NOTICES === Motor Carrier Tariff Federal law requires motor carriers to maintain a written or electronic copy of the \"rates, classifications, rules and practices\" that apply to its shipments (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13710).

Before tendering Goods that require specialized handling or which are dangerous or hazardous, Depositor must identify the Goods and special handling requirements to Warehouse Operator in writing, and Warehouse Operator must specifically agree to store such Goods. Depositor is solely responsible for providing complete and accurate handling and storage instructions for such Goods, including any applicable safety procedures. If such Goods create a risk of harm to persons or property, or if continued storage becomes impractical, Warehouse Operator may require Depositor to take delivery of such Goods, or may dispose of such Goods at Depositor\u2019s risk and expense. (a) For all Goods shipped to the Warehouse, Depositor shall ensure that the bill of lading or other contract of carriage (\"Transportation Contract\") (a) identifies Depositor as the named consignee, in care of Warehouse Operator, and (b) does not identify Warehouse Operator as the consignee.

Depositor agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Warehouse Operator harmless from any costs, liabilities, actions, penalties, or expenses of any kinds associated with the improper declaration of Warehouse Operator as consignee. \u00a7 4. Indemnity. Depositor shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Warehouse Operator [and its [officers,] [directors,] employees, agents, affiliates, successors, and permitted assigns] (collectively, \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including undercharges, rail demurrage, truck/intermodal detention or related charges and [reasonable] attorneys' fees, fees, and the costs of enforcing any right to indemnification under this Warehouse Receipt and the cost of pursuing any insurance providers, [incurred by Indemnified Party/awarded against Indemnified Party], [relating to/arising out of or resulting from] any claim of a third party [or Warehouse Operator] arising out of or occurring in connection with the Services or from Warehouse Operator\u2019s or Depositor\u2019s negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of this Warehouse Receipt (each, a \"Warehouse Claim\"). Depositor shall not enter into any settlement of a Warehouse Claim without Warehouse Operator\u2019s or Indemnified Party\u2019s prior written consent. 5. Access and Release of Goods.

Warehouse Operator may without liability rely on any information contained in any instructions or other communication from Depositor. 501. Depositor. Depositor shall be responsible for all shipping, handling, and other charges assessed by carriers and other third parties in connection with the delivery and/or other shipment of the Goods. A Release Order providing instructions to transfer Goods on the books of Warehouse Operator to any other depositor of goods in the Warehouse will not be effective until such Release Order is delivered to and accepted by Warehouse Operator. The depositor of record shall be responsible for all charges up to the time the actual transfer of the applicable Goods is made. When Goods in storage are transferred from one party to another through issuance of a new warehouse receipt, a new storage date for the transferee will be established effective on the date of transfer. Warehouse Operator may move, upon [NUMBER] days' notice to Depositor any Goods in storage from the Warehouse to any of the other warehouses belonging to or operated by Warehouse Operator. Warehouse Operator may, without notice, move the Goods within the Warehouse in which the Goods are stored. 6. Warehouse Lien. Warehouse Operator shall have a lien on the Goods and upon the proceeds from the sale thereof to secure Depositor\u2019s payment of all fees, charges, and expenses hereunder in connection with the storage, transportation, preservation, and handling of the Goods. Warehouse Operator may enforce this lien at any time, including, by selling all or any part of the Goods in accordance with applicable law. 7. Storage Charges. Depositor shall pay the storage charges and service fees at the rates set forth on [the face side hereof/Warehouse Operator\u2019s Rate Sheet in effect at the time such charges accrue or the services are performed]. All Goods are stored on a month-to-month basis. All charges for storage are per package, or other unit specified on the face side hereof, per month. [Warehouse Operator may, upon thirty days written notice, revise its rates during the time the Goods are in storage.] The current Rate Sheet shall be provided at the time of deposit of Goods into storage and upon request by Depositor. Notwithstanding the above, (a) a full month\u2019s storage charge will apply to all Goods received between the first and the 15 th , inclusive, of a calendar month; (b) one-half month\u2019s storage charge will apply to all Goods received between the 16 th and last day, inclusive, of a calendar month; and \u00a9 a full month\u2019s storage charge will apply to all Goods in storage on the first day of a calendar month. Standard services are limited to the ordinary labor involved in receiving tendered Goods at the warehouse door, placing Goods in storage, and returning Goods (that are to be dispatched from the Warehouse) to warehouse door. Additional charges apply to other specified services at the rates set forth on [the face side hereof/Warehouse Operator\u2019s Rate Sheet in effect at the time such charges accrue or the services are performed], and will be separately billed as such services are performed. All charges are exclusive of all sales, use, and excise taxes, and any other similar taxes, duties and charges of any kind imposed by any governmental authority on any amounts payable by Depositor. Depositor shall be responsible for all such charges, costs, and taxes; provided, that, Depositor shall not be responsible for any taxes imposed on, or with respect to, Warehouse Operator\u2019s income, revenues, gross receipts, personnel, or real or personal property. Depositor is subject to and shall pay the minimum handling charge per lot and a minimum storage charge per lot per month specified on [the face side hereof/Warehouse Operator\u2019s Rate Sheet in effect at the time such charge accrues or the services are performed]. === [2] ACCEPTANCE A warehouse receipt is a document prepared by the warehouse operator containing its quoted rates and other terms and conditions. It is treated as an offer to enter into a contract that must be accepted by the depositor to form a contract. This Standard Document provides for two methods of acceptance: Acceptance by countersignature. The depositor can signify its acceptance of the offer by countersigning the warehouse receipt on the face side of the document and returning an executed copy within the specified number of days after the offer is made (proposal date). Acceptance by tender of goods. If the depositor does not countersign the warehouse receipt, the warehouse receipt is deemed accepted when the depositor tenders the goods referred to in the warehouse receipt and accepts the warehouse receipt issued. The warehouse operator is under no obligation to accept tender of any goods if the depositor has not proffered its acceptance by timely countersignature or tender of goods. Any untimely tender of goods by the depositor is treated as an offer by the depositor to enter into a contract under the terms and conditions of the warehouse receipt, which the warehouse operator can accept by accepting tender of the goods. Therefore, any goods tendered in the manner contemplated by Section 2 and accepted by the warehouse operator constitute goods that are subject to all the terms and conditions of the warehouse receipt. [3] TENDER OF GOODS FOR STORAGE Section 3 sets out some of the basic ground rules to the proper tender of goods for storage. The depositor must: Confirm that it has the right to store the goods with the warehouse operator. Tender the goods only during the normal business hours of the warehouse. To ensure that all goods are properly accounted for, the depositor must also: Properly pack the goods for storage, including affixing proper labels. Provide the warehouse operator with a manifest with detailed information about each tender of goods. The second paragraph helps to reduce the risk that any transportation provider that delivers the goods to the warehouse on behalf of the depositor can make a claim against the warehouse operator for payment of transportation charges by requiring the depositor to: Identify the warehouse operator as a service provider, rather than the owner of the goods. Notify and correct any potential misunderstanding of the carrier that the warehouse operator may have title or an interest in the goods. [4] INDEMNITY This pro-warehouse operator Standard Document contains a one-way indemnity by the depositor in favor of the warehouse operator. The indemnity covers claims arising out of or incurred in connection with the warehouse receipt, including any breach of the warehouse receipt by the depositor for example, any breach of Section 3 resulting in any losses incurred by the warehouse operator due to: Its involvement in a third-party claim that is adverse to the depositor\u2019s rights in the goods. Any claim by a carrier for transportation charges that should rightfully be borne by the depositor. The bracketed definition of indemnified party includes third parties. Therefore, if the warehouse operator wants to ensure that those third parties can seek remedies under this indemnification provision, it should carve them out from Section 14. [5] ACCESS & RELEASE OF GOODS he warehouse operator is also entitled to rely on information and directions received from the depositor concerning the depositor\u2019s goods. This clause aims to ensure that the warehouse operator: Is not strictly held to any specific deadlines. Has flexibility in its ability to move stored goods within the warehouse the goods are in or to other warehouses operated by the warehouse operator. [6] WAREHOUSE LIEN Section 6 confirms that the warehouse operator has a statutory lien under UCC Article 7 in the warehoused goods to secure the depositor\u2019s obligation to pay the storage and related charges set out in Section 7 (UCC \u00a7 7-209(a)). Section 11 gives the warehouse operator the right to terminate the agreement if the goods are about to deteriorate or decline in value to less than the amount of the warehouse lien set out in Section 5 before the end of the next succeeding storage month. Third-party lenders, including vendors that provide purchase money financing to the depositor, however, typically want assurances from the depositor that the depositor can provide the lender a first priority security interest in any warehoused goods. Therefore, as a condition to financing, the lender typically requires the depositor to obtain the warehouse operator\u2019s: Agreement that the lender\u2019s security interest prevails over any lien or security interest that the warehouse operator may have in the warehoused goods. Acknowledgement that it does not have any rights in the goods that would interfere with the lender\u2019s first priority security interest. Authentication that it holds or acknowledges that it will hold possession of the warehoused goods for the lender\u2019s benefit to overcome any presumption that the warehouse operator may have a possessory security interest in the goods (UCC \u00a7 9-313\u00a9(1) and \u00a9(2)). [7] STORAGE CHARGES The warehouse operator can incorporate pricing information in: The face side of the warehouse receipt. The warehouse operator\u2019s then current price list. Many warehouse operators prefer to set their prices by reference to a price list because it: Provides them with greater flexibility. Avoids the need for a price adjustment clause. Section 7 identifies a monthly billing period, although the warehouse operator is free to specify some other period of time, for example, biweekly or quarterly. This Standard Document contemplates the provision of standard storage and related services. Special services are subject to additional charges that the warehouse operator can include on the face side of the warehouse receipt or on its rate schedule. Special services might include: Inspecting the goods. Unloading damaged goods Receiving or delivering goods outside of normal business hours. Reporting serial numbers, marked weights, or other data from packages. Supplying packing materials or other special supplies. Furnishing special communications to or on behalf of the depositor, for example, by overnight courier. Furnishing insurance on the goods.","title":"Warehousing"},{"location":"supply-chain/non-negotiable-warehouse-receipt/#_1","text":"@title : NON - NEGOTIABLE WAREHOUSE RECEIPT @version : 19.25 @copyright : CC - BY - NC - ND - 2.5 @notice : UCC @file : non - negotiable - warehouse - receipt . md @params : ${ ENV } , [ BRACKET ]","title":""},{"location":"supply-chain/non-negotiable-warehouse-receipt/#non-negotiable-warehouse-receipt","text":"","title":"NON-NEGOTIABLE WAREHOUSE RECEIPT"},{"location":"supply-chain/non-negotiable-warehouse-receipt/#-1-applicability","text":"${NAME OF WAREHOUSE OPERATOR} (\"Warehouse Operator\") shall provide warehousing, storage, handling, delivery, and related services (the \"Services\") for the goods described on the face side hereof (the \"Goods\") on behalf of the depositor named on the face side hereof (\"Depositor\") pursuant to these terms and conditions, together with the quotations, terms, and conditions contained on the face side of this document (collectively, this \"Warehouse Receipt\").
