= Freight Trust Code of Conduct

Freight Trust Network is a collaborative project from Freight Trust & Clearing Corporation.
It is an open-source and open community project where participants choose to work together, and in that process experience differences in language, location, nationality, and experience.
In such a diverse environment, misunderstandings and disagreements happen, which in most cases can be resolved informally.
In rare cases, however, behavior can intimidate, harass, or otherwise disrupt one or more people in the community, which Freight Trust Network and Freight Trust & Clearing will not tolerate.

A Code of Conduct is useful to define accepted and acceptable behaviors and to promote high standards of professional practice.
It also provides a benchmark for self evaluation and acts as a vehicle for better identity of the organization.

This code (CoC) applies to any member of the Freight Trust community -- developers, participants in meetings, teleconferences, mailing lists, conferences or functions, etc.
Note that this code complements rather than replaces legal rights and obligations pertaining to any particular situation.

Statement of Intent Freight Trust is committed to maintain a positive work environment.
This commitment calls for a workplace where participants at all levels behave according to the rules of the following code.
A foundational concept of this code is that we all share responsibility for our work environment.

== Code

Treat each other with respect, professionalism, fairness, and sensitivity to our many differences and strengths, including in situations of high pressure and urgency.

* Never harass or bully anyone verbally, physically or sexually.
* Never discriminate on the basis of personal characteristics or group membership.
* Communicate constructively and avoid demeaning or insulting behavior or language.
* Seek, accept, and offer objective work criticism, and acknowledge properly the contributions of others.
* Be honest about your own qualifications, and about any circumstances that might lead to conflicts of interest.
* Respect the privacy of others and the confidentiality of data you access.
* With respect to cultural differences, be conservative in what you do and conservative in what you accept from others, but not to the point of accepting disrespectful, unprofessional or unfair or unwelcome behavior or advances.
* Promote the rules of this Code and take action (especially if you are in a leadership position) to bring the discussion back to a more civil level whenever inappropriate behaviors are observed.

Stay on topic: Make sure that you are posting to the correct channel and avoid off-topic discussions.
Remember when you update an issue or respond to an email you are potentially sending to a large number of people.

Step down considerately: Members of every project come and go, and the Freight Trust is no different.
When you leave or disengage from the project, in whole or in part, we ask that you do so in a way that minimizes disruption to the project.
This means you should tell people you are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where you left off.

_Sexual Harassment_ includes visual displays of degrading sexual images, sexually suggestive conduct, offensive remarks of a sexual nature, requests for sexual favors, unwelcome physical contact, and sexual assault.

_Unwelcome Behavior_ Hard to define?
Some questions to ask yourself are:

how would I feel if I were in the position of the recipient?

would my spouse, parent, child, sibling or friend like to be treated this way?

would I like an account of my behavior published in the organization's newsletter?

could my behavior offend or hurt other members of the work group?

could someone misinterpret my behavior as intentionally harmful or harassing?

would I treat my boss or a person I admire at work like that ?

Summary: if you are unsure whether something might be welcome or unwelcome, don't do it.

submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment,
