<blockquote>
<p>based on the Individual Contributor exclusive License Agreement (including the TRADITIONAL PATENT LICENSE OPTION)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you for your interest in contributing to FreightTrust and Clearing Corporation&rsquo;s Freight Trust
(&ldquo;We&rdquo; or &ldquo;Us&rdquo;).
The purpose of this contributor agreement (&ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) is to clarify and document the rights granted
by contributors to Us. To make this document effective, please follow the instructions at
freighttrust.com/cla-agreement.</p>
<h3 id="0-preamble">0. Preamble</h3>
<p>Software is deeply embedded in all aspects of our lives and it is important that it empower, rather than
restrict us. Free Software gives everybody the rights to use, understand, adapt and share software.
These rights help support other fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech, press and privacy.
Development of Free Software can follow many patterns. In some cases whole development is
handled by a sole programmer or a small group of people. But usually, the creation and maintenance
of software is a complex process that requires the contribution of many individuals. This also affects
who owns the rights to the software. In the latter case, rights in software are owned jointly by a great
number of individuals.
To tackle this issue some projects require a full copyright assignment to be signed by all contributors.
The problem with such assignments is that they often lack checks and balances that would protect the
contributors from potential abuse of power from the new copyright holder.
FSFEâ€™s Fiduciary License Agreement (FLA) was created by the Free Software Foundation
Europe e.V. with just that in mind â€“ to concentrate all deciding power within one entity and prevent
fragmentation of rights on one hand, while on the other preventing that single entity from abusing its
power. The main aim is to ensure that the software covered under the FLA will forever remain Free
Software.
This process only serves for the transfer of economic rights. So-called moral rights (e.g. authors right
to be identified as author) remain with the original author(s) and are inalienable.
How to use this FLA
If You are an employee and have created the Contribution as part of your employment, You need to
have Your employer approve this Agreement or sign the Entity version of this document. If You do not
own the Copyright in the entire work of authorship, any other author of the Contribution should also
sign this â€“ in any event, please contact Us at admin@freighttrust.com
1. Definitions
&ldquo;You&rdquo; means the individual Copyright owner who Submits a Contribution to Us.
&ldquo;Contribution&rdquo; means any original work of authorship, including any original modifications or
additions to an existing work of authorship, Submitted by You to Us, in which You own the Copyright.
&ldquo;Copyright&rdquo; means all rights protecting works of authorship, including copyright, moral and
neighboring rights, as appropriate, for the full term of their existence.
&ldquo;Material&rdquo; means the software or documentation made available by Us to third parties. When this
Agreement covers more than one software project, the Material means the software or documentation
to which the Contribution was Submitted. After You Submit the Contribution, it may be included in the
Material.
&ldquo;Submit&rdquo; means any act by which a Contribution is transferred to Us by You by means of tangible or
intangible media, including but not limited to electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and
issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Us, but excluding any transfer that is
conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as &ldquo;Not a Contribution.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Documentation&rdquo; means any non-software portion of a Contribution.
