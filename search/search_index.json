All memory locations are initially zero. Program code is stored in a ROM, not easily accessible Jumps A JUMP or JUMPI instruction sets the program counter and therefore starts execution off again from some newly- specified instruction. These must jump to some explicit JUMPDEST instruction, that is not an argument literal of another instruction. Exceptions There is only one type of exception. If one occurs, return to the state prior to the current execution, but consume all gas. Exceptions may occur in any of the following circumstances: There is insufficient remaining gas to cover the cost of an instruction; An undefined instruction is to be executed; A jump to an invalid destination occurs. The stack size would exceed 1024 if the next instruction were to be executed Fees Gas fees may be charged for the following reasons: Intrinsic fees charged for computation performed by each instruction gas may be deducted to pay for a subordinate contract call or creation gas may be paid to compensate for extra memory usage Execution Environment The currently executing contract has access to a tuple I , with the following fields: I_a : the address of the account owning the executing code I_o : the address of the transaction originating this execution I_p : the gas price in the originating transaction I_d : a byte array of the input data I_s : sender address I_v : the value ( in wei ) passed to this account I_b : the byte array containing the machine code to be executed I_H : the current block header I_e : the current contract stack depth ( number of CALL and CREATE instructions that have been executed ) The memory state \u03bc , of the currently running contract, is itself subdivided thus: \u03bc _s : the stack , holds up to 1024 words ; initially empty \u03bc _m : memory contents , initially implicitly 2 ^ 256 bytes of zeroes ( word - addressed byte array , words stored big - endian ); \u03bc _g : remaining gas \u03bc _pc : The program counter ( a positive 256 bit integer ) \u03bc _i : the size of the active memory region in words We also have a substate A, maintained during execution, which contains the following fields (initially empty or zero): A_s : The suicide set . Accounts to be discarded following transaction completion . A_l : Log series . archived and indexable \"checkpoints\" that help contract calls to be tracked . A_r : Refund balance , accrued by setting nonzero values in \u03c3 to zero , using the SSTORE instruction . Execution At each instruction, gas fees are charged, state is update, and the program counter increments (or jumps). Instructions Definitions \u03bc : the EVM 's memory; by a slight overloading of terms, this shall mean the same thing as \u03bc_m , above. If a value v is said to be saved to memory at address \u03b1, this means \u03bc[\u03b1] <- v. If v is a word, it is saved in big- endian order in the address range [\u03b1, \u03b1 + 31]. \u03c4 : the EVM' s execution stack ; the same thing as \u03bc_s , above . We have \u03c4 [ 0 ] the top stack element , and \u03c4 [ k ] the element k from the top . If an instruction pops m values off the stack and pushes n values onto it , this behaviour will be denoted - m + n in the table . The size of the stack aer an operation is then ( n - m ). The result of operations is usually pushed to the stack . \u03c1 : the persistent storage available to the executing account . This is equivalent to \u03c3 [ I_a ] . I_d : a byte array of extra data that may have been included with the transaction as input to the currently running contract . I_b : the bytecode of the currently running contract . wei : the smallest denomination of the ether currency ether . 10 ^ 18 wei constitutes one ether . All ether values will be given in wei . Behaviour will mostly be given approximately, and in English. See the yellow paper for precise definitions.

EDI Costs Versus Benefits A paper purchase order requires resources to print the document, fax it, or post it to the vendor. EDI automatically sends the electronic document to the vendor thus reducing the cost of sending the PO. Studies of the cost savings of implementing EDI have been performed, including a report from the Aberdeen group in 2008, which highlighted that in the US it cost $37.45 to produce and send a paper PO, while it only cost $23.83 to send it using EDI. Not all companies use EDI. There is a cost to implement and maintain the technology required to perform EDI. Each trading partner that a company wants to use EDI with may require resources to set up and this can be cost-prohibitive for smaller companies or companies without technical resources. EDI How It Works There are a number of ways EDI messages are transmitted between trading partners. The most common method was to use a value-added network or VAN. This allowed companies to send a transmission which was then reviewed by the VAN and then sent to the correct recipient. Think of Freight Trust Network as a Value Added Network More recently a new method for EDI transmission is being used. This is called AS2, which stands for Applicability Statement 2, and was championed by Wal-Mart, who requires all of their vendors to use this method. Using AS2, the EDI documents are transmitted across the internet and the security of the document is achieved by encryption and the use of digital certificates. There are dozens of EDI documents that can be implemented by a company and their trading partners. Under the ANSI ASC X12 standard, EDI documents are part of a series, for example, such as an order series, a warehousing series, or a financial series. Many companies will only implement a small number of EDI documents with their trading partners, commonly in the ordering series, material handling series and the delivery series. We have over 20,000 mappings and counting, think of us not only as a Value Added Network, but a Marketplace where you can quickly get and start selling to other businesses For example a company who is implementing EDI between themselves and a third party logistics company may only implement five EDI documents such as an EDI 940 for a warehouse shipping order, EDI 943 for a warehouse stock transfer shipment advice, EDI 944 for a warehouse stock transfer receipt advice, EDI 945 for a warehouse shipping advice, and EDI 947 for a warehouse inventory adjustment advice.

Policies for scheduling network upgrades outside these windows are also described. This is a modified document from EIP-1872 Abstract Four different weeks, spaced roughly evenly throughout the year, are targeted for network upgrades to be launched. Regular network upgrades should announce their intention to launch in a particular window early in their process and choose a block number four to six weeks prior to that window. If a network upgrade is cancelled then it would be rescheduled for the next window. Not all windows will be used. Priority upgrades outside the roadmap may be scheduled in the third week of any month, but such use is discouraged. Critical upgrades are scheduled as needed. Motivation The aim of this NIP is to provide some level of regularity and predictability to the Freight Trust network upgrade/hard fork process. This will allow service providers such as exchanges and node operators a predictable framework to schedule activities around. This also provides a framework to regularize the delivery of network upgrades. Specification Scheduling is defined for three categories of network upgrades. First are Roadmap network upgrades that include deliberate protocol improvements. Next are Priority network updates, where there are technical reasons that necessitate a prompt protocol change but these reasons do not present a systemic risk to the protocol or the ecosystem. Finally, Critical network upgrades are to address issues that present a systemic risk to the protocol or the ecosystem. Network Upgrades Roadmap network upgrades are network upgrades that are deliberate and measured to improve the protocol and ecosystem. Historical examples are Homestead, Byzantium, and Constantinople. Upgrade Scheduling Upgrades should be scheduled in one of four windows: the week with the third Wednesday in January, April, July, and October. When initiating a network upgrade or early in the planning process a particular window should be targeted. Note to reviewers: The months and week chosen are to provide an initial recommendation and are easily modifiable prior to final call. They thread the needle between many third quarter and fourth quarter holidays. Operational Implementation Implementors are expected to have software for a Roadmap network upgrade ready two to four weeks prior to the upgrade. Hence a block number for the network upgrade should be chosen four to six weeks prior to the network upgrade window. Scheduling details such as whether this choice is made prior to or after testnet deployment are out of scope of this NIP. Depending on the release cadence of Roadmap network upgrades some windows will not be used. For example if a six month release cadence is chosen a roadmap upgrade would not occur in adjacent upgrade windows. Hence for a six month cadence if a roadmap upgrade occurred in April then the July window would not be used for network upgrades. If a planned roadmap upgrade needs to be rescheduled then strong consideration should be given to rescheduling the upgrade for the next window in three months time. For the case of a six month cadence this may cause releases to be in adjacent release windows. For a three month cadence the next network upgrade would be merged with the current upgrade or the next network upgrade would be delayed. To be compatible with the scheduled release windows the cadence of the Roadmap Network Upgrades should be a multiple of three months. Whether it is three, six, nine, or more month cadence is out of scope of this NIP. Emergency Procedures Priority Network Upgrades Priority network upgrades are reserved for upgrades that require more urgency than a roadmap network upgrade yet do not present a systemic risk to the network or the ecosystem. To date there have been no examples of a priority upgrade. Possible examples may include roadmap upgrades that need to occur in multiple upgrades or for security risks that have a existing mitigation in place that would be better served by a network upgrade. Priority network upgrades are best launched in unused roadmap launch windows, namely the third week of January, April, July, and October. If necessary they may be launched in the third week of any month, but strong consideration and preference should be given to unused roadmap launch windows. Priority network upgrades should be announced and a block chosen far enough in advance so major clients implementors can release software with the needed block number in a timely fashion. These releases should occur at least a week before the launch window. Hence priority launch windows should be chosen two to four weeks in advance. Critical Upgrades Critical Network Upgrades Critical network upgrades are network upgrades that are designed to address systemic risks to the protocol or to the ecosystem. Historical examples include Dao Fork, Tangerine Whistle, and Spurious Dragon. This NIP provides neither guidance nor restrictions to the development and deployment of these emergency hard forks. These upgrades are typically launched promptly after a solution to the systemic risk is agreed upon between the client implementors. It is recommended that such upgrades perform the minimum amount of changes needed to address the issues that caused the need for the Critical network upgrade and that other changes be integrated into subsequent Priority and Roadmap network upgrades. Network Upgrade Block Number Choice When choosing an activation block the number can be used to communicate the role of a particular network in the Freight Trust Network and in general the Ethereum Ecosystem (mainnet=foundation). Networks that serve as a value store or are otherwise production grade have different stability concerns than networks that serve as technology demonstration or are explicitly designated for testing. To date all Mainnet activation blocks have ended in three or more zeros, including Critical Network Upgrades for the Ethereum Foundation. To continue this pattern network upgrade activation block numbers for mainnet deployments and production grade networks should chose a number whose base 10 representation ends with three or more zeros. Network Upgrade Nomenclature For testnet and testing or development grades network operators are encouraged to choose a block activation number that is a palindrome in base 10. Block numbers for Roadmap and Priority network upgrades should be chosen so that it is forecast to occur relatively close to Wednesday at 12:00 UTC+0 during the launch window. This should result in an actual block production occurring sometime between Monday and Friday of the chosen week. Activation Numbers Activation Numbers for Freight Trust Network Network Procedure mainnet three or more zeros (3+ 0\u2019s) testnets palindrome in base 10. Rationale The rationale for defining launch windows is to give business running Freight Trust infrastructure a predictable schedule for when upgrades may or may not occur. Knowing when a upgrade is not going to occur gives the businesses a clear time frame within which to perform internal upgrades free from external changes. It also provides a timetable for developers and IT professionals to schedule time off against. Backwards Compatibility (Ethereum Foundation Network) Except for the specific launch windows the previous network upgrades would have complied with these policies. Homestead, Byzantium, and Constantinople would have been Roadmap Network Upgrades. There were no Priority Network Upgrades. Dao Fork was a Critical Network Upgrade in response to TheDao. Tangerine Whistle and Spurious Dragon were critical upgrades in response to the Shanghai Spam Attacks. Constantinople Fix (as it is termed in the reference tests) was in response to the https://eips.ethereum.org/ ( EIP-1283 security issues. If this policy were in place prior to Constantinople then the initial 2018 launch would likely have been bumped to the next window after the Ropsten testnet consensus failures. The NIP-1283 issues likely would have resulted in an out of window upgrade because of the impact of the difficulty bomb. Implementation The windows in this NIP are expected to start after the Istanbul Network upgrade, which is the next planned Roadmap upgrade (aka hard forks) should be performed within.

Federal Bills of Lading Act The Federal Act governs bills of lading that are used in interstate or foreign commerce. Specifically, the Federal Act applies to all bills of lading that a common carrier issues for goods transported: (a). Between a location in: (i) Washington DC and another location in Washington DC; (ii) a US territory or possession and another location in the same territory or possession; (iii) a US state and a location in another US state; or (iv) a US state and a location in the same state through another US state or a foreign country.

UCC Article 7 Article 7 of the UCC governs bills of lading when the transaction or shipment relates to intrastate commerce. Article 7 of the UCC supplements, but is generally consistent with, the Federal Act. How Bills of Lading Are Used A bill of lading is an agreement between a consignor of goods and the carrier transporting the goods. The bill of lading serves as both: A receipt that provides the consignor with evidence of the goods' delivery to the carrier. A contract that states the terms and conditions under which the carrier agrees to transport the goods. The parties generally engaged in a transaction involving a bill of lading are: The shipper or consignor. The shipper or consignor is the party sending the goods. The carrier or bailee. The carrier (or bailee under the UCC) has possession of the goods and contracts to deliver them. The consignee. The consignee is the party to whom the goods are delivered. The carrier or its agent signs the bill of lading and issues it to the consignor. The consignor then typically sends the consignee or its agent the bill of lading through mail or another means of communication. Any kind of carrier can issue a bill of lading, regardless of the transportation method (whether by land, water, or air). The carrier issues the bill of lading to the consignor at either: The place of shipment [x]. The destination point [y]. Any other designated place that the consignor requests. The carrier then delivers the goods covered in the bill of lading to either: The order of a consignor or consignee, if the bill of lading is negotiable (for an explanation of negotiable bills of lading, see Order Bill of Lading). A specifically named consignee, if the bill of lading is nonnegotiable (for an explanation of nonnegotiable bills of lading, see Straight Bill of Lading).

Legacy Implementation Note (v1): Functional equivalence of possession is achieved when a reliable method is employed to establish control of that record by a person and to identify the person in control. The notion of control when used as a substitute for possession requires a reliable method for identifying the current party in control of a specific electronic record as the said notion typically focuses on the identity of the person entitled to enforce the rights embodied in the electronic transferable record. The method of identification may be accomplished through a closed system, or through an open system. Under the draft model law, the notion of original and uniqueness has been connected to control. Emphasis has been given to reliably ensure that the claim may be presented to the debtor only once. Documents capable for version 2 of protocol (legal parity is version 2, functional equivalence is version 1 or \"legacy\") An indicative list of transferable documents or instruments includes: bills of exchange, cheques, promissory notes, consignment notes, bills of lading, warehouse receipts, cargo insurance certificates and air waybills. Negotiable Bills of Lading A common carrier issuing a negotiable bill of lading has a lien on the goods covered by the bill for\u2013 (1) charges for storage, transportation, and delivery (including demurrage and terminal charges), and expenses necessary to preserve the goods or incidental to transporting the goods after the date of the bill; and (2) other charges for which the bill expressly specifies a lien is claimed to the extent the charges are allowed by law and the agreement between the consignor and carrier.

Replicate the function of paper bills, including a party\u2019s ability to issue, indorse, recut or surrender the e-bill; c. Replicate the physical transfer of paper bills and, whilst all parties can view an e-bill (in copy form), the trading platform restricts access and indorsement to the current lawful holder (by way of fob and access code) as the e-bills securely move from one party to the next; and d. Can be converted into paper bills, allowing them to be finally traded with parties which have not signed up to the ETS platform. However, it is notable that paper bills cannot be converted into e-bills since none of the ETS would be prepared to investigate and effectively warrant the provenance of paper bills and the physical cargo they represent. Replacement of a transferable document or instrument with an electronic transferable record An electronic transferable record may replace a transferable document or instrument if a reliable method for the change of medium is used. For the change of medium to take effect, a statement indicating a change of medium shall be inserted in the electronic transferable record. Upon issuance of the electronic transferable record in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2, the transferable document or instrument shall be made inoperative and ceases to have any effect or validity. A change of medium in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not affect the rights and obligations of the parties.

Bills of Lading have 3 groups: Master, FTL and LTL LTL Rules of Use for the Standard Bill of Lading # source: VICS BOL Standard The guidelines to the Bill of Lading are designed so that the U.S. industry may benefit from a form that is consistent and understandable. The standard VICS BOL is intended for U.S. LTL and TL ground transport. It is particularly critical that all businesses using the form adhere to its design so that the supply chain may take advantage of these benefits. Listed below is additional detail regarding the use of the standard Bill of Lading. Adjustments to the VICS Bill of Lading can be made based on the following guidelines: The geographical placement of data and data descriptions must be kept intact according to this standard. This is important to ensure that all parties within the supply chain will know where to locate the specific information they need. Each section or data description area may be modified to fit the supply chain business requirements as follows: Spacing Column width Row height Removal of the data lines in the Customer and Carrier Information sections when either the form or data is computer printed. When the form is loaded into a software program, all sections shall be clearly identified and the appropriate form lines and headings must be present. To support North America cross boarder ground shipments, the section headings can be modified to include bilingual wording. If cube information is being provided, the cube data column should be inserted between the Weight and Pallet/Slip column in the Customer Order Section. The following data must be 12-point Bold: a) Bill of Lading number c) Ship to Location number b) SCAC/Pro number d) Customer Order Number When printing processes do not allow for variances in point size and bolding, the above data must be displayed with adequate spacing and high quality printing to support ease of recognition and data entry by the carriers. The CID number shall be in 10-point and bolded. All other data input items may be in a 10-point or smaller (See Section I Page 3 & 4 on legal statements), no bolding. Printing: The standard Bill of Lading may be duplicated and printed in multiple part forms by any printing company or shipper. If the Supplement page is used, the best practice has been to print the Supplement page(s) first, then print the front Bill of Lading page with the Grand Totals last. The Bill of Lading page must then be placed in front of the Supplement page(s). Pagination: In general, each bill of lading (including any supplement pages) and attachments are considered separate documents. For example: a) BOL with 3 supplement pages: BOL = page 1, Supplement = pages 2, 3 and 4 b) Master BOL with 2 underlying BOL\u2019s; underlying BOL\u2019s with 2 supplement pages: Master BOL = page 1, First underlying BOL = page 1, supplement pages = 2, 3 Second underlying BOL = page 1, supplement pages =2, 3. c) BOL with an attachment (e.g., packing list and /or shipping manifest): BOL = page 1, attachment one = pages 1, 2\u2026\u200b, attachment two = pages 1, 2\u2026\u200b. IV. Rules of Use for the Standard Bill of Lading 14 The Bill of Lading is not to be used as a packing list; the packing list is to be on a separate document. In addition, the following items are not part of the Bill of Lading and shall not be included on the Bill of Lading. However, these documents are considered as potential attachments to the Bill of Lading. Packing List line item information. Shipping Manifest - The Shipping Manifest is a document generated by the shipper for a customer pertaining to store shipments that are shipped to a customer specified intermediate location (i.e., distribution center, consolidator) with the individual cartons marked for specific store locations. The manifest contains store level detail that typically includes store location numbers, store addresses, customer order numbers, number of cartons per order per store and weight/cube totals.

Legacy Implementation Note (v1): Functional equivalence of possession is achieved when a reliable method is employed to establish control of that record by a person and to identify the person in control. The notion of control when used as a substitute for possession requires a reliable method for identifying the current party in control of a specific electronic record as the said notion typically focuses on the identity of the person entitled to enforce the rights embodied in the electronic transferable record. The method of identification may be accomplished through a closed system, or through an open system. Under the draft model law, the notion of original and uniqueness has been connected to control. Emphasis has been given to reliably ensure that the claim may be presented to the debtor only once. Documents capable for version 2 of protocol (legal parity is version 2, functional equivalence is version 1 or \"legacy\") An indicative list of transferable documents or instruments includes: bills of exchange, cheques, promissory notes, consignment notes, bills of lading, warehouse receipts, cargo insurance certificates and air waybills.","title":""},{"location":"rulebook/legal-parity/#negotiable-bills-of-lading","text":"A common carrier issuing a negotiable bill of lading has a lien on the goods covered by the bill for\u2013 (1) charges for storage, transportation, and delivery (including demurrage and terminal charges), and expenses necessary to preserve the goods or incidental to transporting the goods after the date of the bill; and (2) other charges for which the bill expressly specifies a lien is claimed to the extent the charges are allowed by law and the agreement between the consignor and carrier.

The standard VICS BOL is intended for U.S. LTL and TL ground transport. It is particularly critical that all businesses using the form adhere to its design so that the supply chain may take advantage of these benefits. Listed below is additional detail regarding the use of the standard Bill of Lading. Adjustments to the VICS Bill of Lading can be made based on the following guidelines: The geographical placement of data and data descriptions must be kept intact according to this standard. This is important to ensure that all parties within the supply chain will know where to locate the specific information they need. Each section or data description area may be modified to fit the supply chain business requirements as follows: Spacing Column width Row height Removal of the data lines in the Customer and Carrier Information sections when either the form or data is computer printed. When the form is loaded into a software program, all sections shall be clearly identified and the appropriate form lines and headings must be present. To support North America cross boarder ground shipments, the section headings can be modified to include bilingual wording. If cube information is being provided, the cube data column should be inserted between the Weight and Pallet/Slip column in the Customer Order Section. The following data must be 12-point Bold: a) Bill of Lading number c) Ship to Location number b) SCAC/Pro number d) Customer Order Number When printing processes do not allow for variances in point size and bolding, the above data must be displayed with adequate spacing and high quality printing to support ease of recognition and data entry by the carriers. The CID number shall be in 10-point and bolded. All other data input items may be in a 10-point or smaller (See Section I Page 3 & 4 on legal statements), no bolding. Printing: The standard Bill of Lading may be duplicated and printed in multiple part forms by any printing company or shipper. If the Supplement page is used, the best practice has been to print the Supplement page(s) first, then print the front Bill of Lading page with the Grand Totals last. The Bill of Lading page must then be placed in front of the Supplement page(s). Pagination: In general, each bill of lading (including any supplement pages) and attachments are considered separate documents. For example: a) BOL with 3 supplement pages: BOL = page 1, Supplement = pages 2, 3 and 4 b) Master BOL with 2 underlying BOL\u2019s; underlying BOL\u2019s with 2 supplement pages: Master BOL = page 1, First underlying BOL = page 1, supplement pages = 2, 3 Second underlying BOL = page 1, supplement pages =2, 3. c) BOL with an attachment (e.g., packing list and /or shipping manifest): BOL = page 1, attachment one = pages 1, 2\u2026\u200b, attachment two = pages 1, 2\u2026\u200b. IV. Rules of Use for the Standard Bill of Lading 14 The Bill of Lading is not to be used as a packing list; the packing list is to be on a separate document.

The Board, Risk Management Committee, or any Exchange Committee may summarily suspend any Clearing Participant (i) if the Clearing Participant is in Default, (ii) upon the discovery of a materially false or misleading representation or warranty made by the Clearing Participant to FreightTrust Clearing under or in connection with any agreement between FreightTrust Clearing and the Clearing Participant, (iii) if a breach by the Clearing Participant of the Rules or any of the terms or provisions of any agreement between FreightTrust Clearing and the Clearing Participant is not remedied promptly after notice from FreightTrust Clearing, (iv) in the event of a material violation of the Rules of the Exchange or of the Clearinghouse, or (v) if the Board or the Risk Management Committee determines that suspension is necessary for the protection of FreightTrust Clearing, other Clearing Participants, or the general public (whether or not such Clearing Participant continues to meet the required minimum financial requirements pursuant to the Rules). (B). Notice of Suspension to Network and Clearing Participants Upon the suspension of a Clearing Participant, FreightTrust Clearing shall as soon as possible notify all Clearing Participants of the suspension. Such notice shall state to the extent practicable in general terms how pending transactions, open positions and other pending matters will be affected and what steps are to be taken in connection therewith. \u00a9. Pending Transactions Notwithstanding any other provision of the Rules, FreightTrust Clearing shall have no obligation to accept any transaction of a suspended Network and/or Clearing Participant that was effected after the time at which the Clearing Participant was suspended. In the event a transaction of a suspended Clearing Participant is rejected by FreightTrust Clearing, FreightTrust Clearing shall provide notice of such rejection to the other party thereto and such transaction shall be closed by the other party thereto in accordance with the rules of the Exchange. (D). Open Positions * FreightTrust Clearing shall have the right to cause open positions in Contracts in any of the accounts of a suspended Clearing Participant: (i) To be closed in such manner as deemed practicable by FreightTrust Clearing, in its sole discretion; (ii) To be transferred to the account of one or more other Clearing Participants; (iii) To be offset against each other and, to the extent of any remaining imbalance, against the Contracts of other Clearing Participants; or (iv) To be settled at the Settlement Price for such Contracts, or at such other price or prices as FreightTrust Clearing may deem fair and reasonable under the circumstances, in which event FreightTrust Clearing may cause Contracts in the accounts of other Clearing Participants to be settled at such price or prices; (v) Or take any other action with respect to open positions it deems in the best interest of the Clearinghouse or the Clearing Participants. In connection with any action undertaken by FreightTrust Clearing pursuant to subparagraphs (i) through (iv) above, FreightTrust Clearing shall have the right to apply the Margin of the applicable Clearing Participant and any other assets of such Clearing Participant held by, pledged to or otherwise available to FreightTrust Clearing, including any guarantee issued pursuant to these Rules, to discharge the Obligations of such Clearing Participant to FreightTrust Clearing (including any costs and expenses associated with the liquidation, transfer or management of Contracts held in or for the accounts of such Network and/or Clearing Participant, and any fees, assessments or fines imposed by FreightTrust Clearing on such Clearing Participant). FreightTrust Clearing may delegate to specified Officers or agents of FreightTrust Clearing the authority to determine, within such guidelines, if any, as FreightTrust Clearing shall prescribe, the nature and timing of transactions of the type described in subparagraph (i). Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this paragraph (d), if FreightTrust Clearing shall determine, taking into account the size and nature of a suspended Clearing Participant\u2019s positions, market conditions prevailing at the time, the potential market effects of liquidating transactions that might be directed by FreightTrust Clearing, and such other circumstances as FreightTrust Clearing deems relevant, that the closing out of some or all of the suspended Network and/or Clearing Participant\u2019s positions would not be in the best interests of FreightTrust Clearing, other Clearing Participants, or the general public, such positions need not be closed out. (E). Protective Action If FreightTrust Clearing (i) is unable, for any reason, to close out in a prompt and orderly manner any positions or to convert to cash any Margin deposits of a suspended Network and/or Clearing Participant, or (ii) elects pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Rule not to close out any such positions, FreightTrust Clearing may authorize the execution of hedging transactions from time to time for the account of FreightTrust Clearing, solely for the purpose of reducing the risk to FreightTrust Clearing resulting from the continued maintenance of such positions or the continued holding of such Margin deposits. FreightTrust Clearing may delegate to specified Officers or agents of FreightTrust Clearing the authority to determine, within such guidelines, if any, as FreightTrust Clearing shall prescribe, the nature and timing of such hedging transactions. (F). Reimbursement of Costs and Expenses Any costs or expenses, including losses, sustained by FreightTrust Clearing in connection with transactions effected for its account pursuant to this Rule shall be charged to the suspended Clearing Participant, and any gains realized on such transactions shall be credited to such Clearing Participant; provided, however, that costs, expenses, and gains allocable to the hedging of positions in a Customer Account shall be charged or credited, as the case may be, to the Customer Account, and only the excess, if any, of such costs and expenses over the funds available in that account shall be charged to the Clearing Participant. Reasonable allocations of costs, expenses, and gains among accounts made by FreightTrust Clearing for the purpose of implementing the proviso to the preceding sentence shall be binding on the Clearing Participant and any persons claiming through the Clearing Participant and their respective successors and assigns. 602.

The appellant shall be notified in writing of the decision of the Board ; and if the decision shall have been to affirm or modify the suspension , the appellant shall be given a written statement of the grounds therefor . ( D ). The filing of an appeal pursuant to this Rule shall not impair the validity or stay the effect of the suspension appealed from . The reversal or modification of a suspension shall not invalidate any acts of FreightTrust Clearing taken pursuant to such suspension prior to such reversal or modification , and the rights of any person which may arise out of any such acts shall not be affected by such reversal or modification . ( E ). A record shall be kept of any hearing held pursuant hereto . The cost of the transcript may , in the discretion of the body holding the hearing , be charged in whole or in part to the suspended Clearing Participant in the event that the suspension is finally affirmed . 603.

(B). Notice of Suspension to Network and Clearing Participants Upon the suspension of a Clearing Participant, FreightTrust Clearing shall as soon as possible notify all Clearing Participants of the suspension. Such notice shall state to the extent practicable in general terms how pending transactions, open positions and other pending matters will be affected and what steps are to be taken in connection therewith. \u00a9. Pending Transactions Notwithstanding any other provision of the Rules, FreightTrust Clearing shall have no obligation to accept any transaction of a suspended Network and/or Clearing Participant that was effected after the time at which the Clearing Participant was suspended. In the event a transaction of a suspended Clearing Participant is rejected by FreightTrust Clearing, FreightTrust Clearing shall provide notice of such rejection to the other party thereto and such transaction shall be closed by the other party thereto in accordance with the rules of the Exchange. (D). Open Positions * FreightTrust Clearing shall have the right to cause open positions in Contracts in any of the accounts of a suspended Clearing Participant: (i) To be closed in such manner as deemed practicable by FreightTrust Clearing, in its sole discretion; (ii) To be transferred to the account of one or more other Clearing Participants; (iii) To be offset against each other and, to the extent of any remaining imbalance, against the Contracts of other Clearing Participants; or (iv) To be settled at the Settlement Price for such Contracts, or at such other price or prices as FreightTrust Clearing may deem fair and reasonable under the circumstances, in which event FreightTrust Clearing may cause Contracts in the accounts of other Clearing Participants to be settled at such price or prices; (v) Or take any other action with respect to open positions it deems in the best interest of the Clearinghouse or the Clearing Participants.

FreightTrust Clearing may delegate to specified Officers or agents of FreightTrust Clearing the authority to determine, within such guidelines, if any, as FreightTrust Clearing shall prescribe, the nature and timing of transactions of the type described in subparagraph (i). Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this paragraph (d), if FreightTrust Clearing shall determine, taking into account the size and nature of a suspended Clearing Participant\u2019s positions, market conditions prevailing at the time, the potential market effects of liquidating transactions that might be directed by FreightTrust Clearing, and such other circumstances as FreightTrust Clearing deems relevant, that the closing out of some or all of the suspended Network and/or Clearing Participant\u2019s positions would not be in the best interests of FreightTrust Clearing, other Clearing Participants, or the general public, such positions need not be closed out. (E). Protective Action If FreightTrust Clearing (i) is unable, for any reason, to close out in a prompt and orderly manner any positions or to convert to cash any Margin deposits of a suspended Network and/or Clearing Participant, or (ii) elects pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Rule not to close out any such positions, FreightTrust Clearing may authorize the execution of hedging transactions from time to time for the account of FreightTrust Clearing, solely for the purpose of reducing the risk to FreightTrust Clearing resulting from the continued maintenance of such positions or the continued holding of such Margin deposits. FreightTrust Clearing may delegate to specified Officers or agents of FreightTrust Clearing the authority to determine, within such guidelines, if any, as FreightTrust Clearing shall prescribe, the nature and timing of such hedging transactions. (F). Reimbursement of Costs and Expenses Any costs or expenses, including losses, sustained by FreightTrust Clearing in connection with transactions effected for its account pursuant to this Rule shall be charged to the suspended Clearing Participant, and any gains realized on such transactions shall be credited to such Clearing Participant; provided, however, that costs, expenses, and gains allocable to the hedging of positions in a Customer Account shall be charged or credited, as the case may be, to the Customer Account, and only the excess, if any, of such costs and expenses over the funds available in that account shall be charged to the Clearing Participant. Reasonable allocations of costs, expenses, and gains among accounts made by FreightTrust Clearing for the purpose of implementing the proviso to the preceding sentence shall be binding on the Clearing Participant and any persons claiming through the Clearing Participant and their respective successors and assigns.","title":"General"},{"location":"rulebook/suspension/#602-right-of-appeal","text":"A Clearing Participant suspended pursuant to Rule 601 shall be entitled, upon request within five Business Days after the date of its suspension, to a written statement of the grounds for its suspension and shall have the right to appeal its suspension in accordance with the following procedure: ( A ).
