The Application Identifiers (AI\u2019s) are not part of the actual data. The AI is only used at the point of scanning to determine data type and/or size for application system processing. If you choose to implement the bar coding of the BOL number and/or SCAC and Pro# for a carrier, be sure that the carrier is aware of the above requirements. The standard VICS BOL is intended for U.S. LTL and TL ground transport. It is particularly critical that all businesses using the form adhere to its design so that the supply chain may take advantage of these benefits. Listed below is additional detail regarding the use of the standard Bill of Lading. Adjustments Adjustments to the VICS Bill of Lading can be made based on the following guidelines: The geographical placement of data and data descriptions must be kept intact according to this standard. This is important to ensure that all parties within the supply chain will know where to locate the specific information they need. Each section or data description area may be modified to fit the supply chain business requirements as follows: \u2022 Spacing \u2022 Column width \u2022 Row height \u2022 Removal of the data lines in the Customer and Carrier Information sections when either the form or data is computer printed. \u2022 When the form is loaded into a software program, all sections shall be clearly identified and the appropriate form lines and headings must be present. \u2022 To support North America cross boarder ground shipments, the section headings can be modified to include bilingual wording. Note: If cube information is being provided, the cube data column should be inserted between the Weight and Pallet/Slip column in the Customer Order Section. The following data must be 12-point Bold: a) Bill of Lading number c) Ship to Location number b) SCAC/Pro number d) Customer Order Number When printing processes do not allow for variances in point size and bolding, the above data must be displayed with adequate spacing and high quality printing to support ease of recognition and data entry by the carriers. The CID number shall be in 10-point and bolded. All other data input items may be in a 10-point or smaller (See Section I Page 3 & 4 on legal statements), no bolding. 2. Printing: The standard Bill of Lading may be duplicated and printed in multiple part forms by any printing company or shipper. If the Supplement page is used, the best practice has been to print the Supplement page(s) first, then print the front Bill of Lading page with the Grand Totals last. The Bill of Lading page must then be placed in front of the Supplement page(s). 3. Pagination: In general, each bill of lading (including any supplement pages) and attachments are considered separate documents. For example: a) BOL with 3 supplement pages: BOL = page 1, Supplement = pages 2, 3 and 4 b) Master BOL with 2 underlying BOL\u2019s; underlying BOL\u2019s with 2 supplement pages: Master BOL = page 1, First underlying BOL = page 1, supplement pages = 2, 3 Second underlying BOL = page 1, supplement pages =2, 3. c) BOL with an attachment (e.g., packing list and /or shipping manifest): BOL = page 1, attachment one = pages 1, 2\u2026, attachment two = pages 1, 2\u2026. 4. Rules of Use for the Standard Bill of Lading The Bill of Lading is not to be used as a packing list; the packing list is to be on a separate document. In addition, the following items are not part of the Bill of Lading and shall not be included on the Bill of Lading. However, these documents are considered as potential attachments to the Bill of Lading. \u2022 Packing List line item information. \u2022 Shipping Manifest - The Shipping Manifest is a document generated by the shipper for a customer pertaining to store shipments that are shipped to a customer specified intermediate location (i.e., distribution center, consolidator) with the individual cartons marked for specific store locations. The manifest contains store level detail that typically includes store location numbers, store addresses, customer order numbers, number of cartons per order per store and weight/cube totals. \u2022 Hazardous Item List (See Section VII. Hazardous Materials Regulations for instructions) See Appendix E for recommended format, detailed data content explanation and examples. The Canadian PARS sticker for customs belongs on the freight invoice, not on the Bill of Lading. The information conveyed through EDI (e.g. EDI 856, 204, 211, 214) shall be consistent with the information on the paper Bill of Lading. This in no way implies that all information conveyed through any one EDI document will map one-to- one to the paper Bill of Lading. When using the Supplement Page to list customer order number and commodity information, state \u201cSee attached Bill of Lading Supplement\u201d in the body of the first page and begin listing the information on the supplement page. Only the grand total of the cartons and weight for the shipment will be detailed on the first page. No Bill of Lading information shall be placed on the back of the Bill of Lading page.

Data tags can be used in the Customer Order Information Section to identify multiple data elements that may be required by the consignee Use of Master Bill of Lading A Master Bill of Lading is created for three shipment scenarios: Consolidation shipments Invoice per Bill of Lading per customer order Truckload shipments with multiple stops For these scenarios, the purpose of the Master Bill of Lading is to tie the underlying Bills of Lading together into one shipment for freight rating and billing purposes. The standard Bill of Lading is used as a Master Bill of Lading by checking the \u201cMaster Bill of Lading\u201d indicator box. The underlying Bill of Lading numbers shall be referenced in the Special Instructions field on the Master Bill of Lading.

The development of the Supplement Page to the Bill of Lading eliminates the use of a Master Bill of Lading for the purpose of needing more lines to fit all the information on one page (see section V) The Master Bill of Lading shall not be used for this purpose. Often a Master Bill of Lading, with underlying Bills of Lading attached, is used in conjunction with the 856 Ship Notice Manifest and the 214 Carrier Shipment Status EDI transaction sets. In this case, the Master Bill of Lading number is the number that is transmitted on the EDI transaction sets representing that shipment.

(b) Claims for loss or damage must be filed within nine months after the delivery of the Goods (or, in the case of export traffic, within nine months after delivery at the port of export), except that claims for failure to make delivery must be filed within nine months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed. (c) Suits for loss, damage, injury, or delay shall be instituted against Carrier no later than two years and one day from the day when written notice is given by Carrier to the claimant that Carrier has disallowed the claim or any part or parts of the claim specified in the notice. (d) Carrier will have the full benefit of any insurance policies or contracts claimant has in effect on the Goods; provided that Carrier receiving the benefit of such insurance must reimburse the claimant for the premium paid on the insurance policy or contract. 5. Goods not Delivered. (a) If Consignee refuses the shipment tendered for delivery by Carrier or if Carrier is unable to deliver the Goods, because of fault or mistake of Shipper or Consignee, Carrier's liability shall then become that of a warehouseman. Carrier shall promptly attempt to provide notice, by telephonic or electronic communication as provided on the face of this Bill of Lading, if so indicated, to Shipper or the party, if any, designated to receive notice on this Bill of Lading. Storage charges, based on Carrier's tariff, shall start no sooner than the next business day following the attempted notification. Storage may be, at Carrier's option, in any location that provides reasonable protection against loss or damage. Carrier may place the shipment in public storage at Shipper's expense and without liability to the Carrier. (b) If Carrier does not receive disposition instructions within 48 hours of the time of Carrier's attempted first notification, Carrier will make a good faith effort to issue a second and final confirmed notification. Such notice shall advise that if Carrier does not receive disposition instructions within 10 days of that notification, Carrier may offer the Goods for sale at a public auction and Carrier has the right to offer the Goods for sale. (c) The amount of sale will be applied to Carrier's invoice for transportation, storage, and other lawful charges. Shipper shall be responsible for the balance of charges not covered by the sale of the Goods. If there is a balance remaining after all charges and expenses are paid, such balance will be paid to the owner of the Goods sold hereunder, upon claim and proof of ownership. (d) Where Carrier has attempted in good faith to follow the procedure set forth in subsections 4(a), (b) and (c) above to dispose of the Goods and has been unable to do so, Carrier may, at its option, sell the Goods under such circumstances and in such manner as may be authorized by law. (e) When the Goods consist of perishable goods that cannot be delivered and disposition directions are not received by Carrier within a reasonable time, Carrier may sell the Goods at private or public sale. (f) Where Carrier is directed by Shipper or Consignee to unload or deliver Goods at a particular location where Shipper, Consignee, or the agent of either, is not regularly located, Carrier shall have no liability for the Goods after unloading or delivery at such location. SEE NOTE [2] 6. Limitations on Carrier\u2019s Liability. In all cases not prohibited by law, where a lower value than the actual value of the Goods has been stated in writing by Shipper or has been agreed upon by Shipper in writing as the released value of the Goods as determined by the classification or tariffs upon which the rate is based, such lower value plus freight charges if paid shall be the maximum amount of Carrier\u2019s liability for loss or damage, whether or not such loss or damage occurs from Carrier\u2019s negligence. 7. Freight Charges. (a) Shipper or Consignee shall be liable for the freight and other lawful charges accruing on the shipment, as billed or corrected, except that collect shipments may move without recourse to Shipper when Shipper so stipulates by signature or endorsement in the space provided on the face of this Bill of Lading. Nevertheless, Shipper shall remain liable for transportation charges where there has been an erroneous determination of the freight charges assessed, based upon incomplete or incorrect information provided by Shipper. (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) above, Consignee\u2019s liability for payment of additional charges that may be found to be due after delivery shall be as specified by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13706(a), except that Consignee need not provide the specified written notice to the delivering carrier if Consignee is a for-hire carrier. (c) Nothing in this Bill of Lading shall limit the right of Carrier to require the prepayment or guarantee of Carrier\u2019s charges at the time of shipment or prior to delivery. If the description of the Goods or other information on this Bill of Lading is found to be incorrect or incomplete, the freight charges that are due will be based upon the Goods actually shipped. SEE NOTE [3] 8. Items of Extraordinary Value. Carrier will not be required to carry or be liable in any way for any documents, coin money, or articles of extraordinary value not specifically rated in the published classification or tariffs unless a special agreement to do so and a stipulated value of the articles are indorsed on the face side of this Bill of Lading. SEE NOTE [4] 9. Explosives, Dangerous, or Hazardous Goods. If Shipper ships explosives, dangerous, or hazardous goods without previous full written disclosure to Carrier of their nature, Shipper shall be liable for and indemnify Carrier against all loss or damage caused by those goods. Carrier may, but shall have no obligation to, warehouse such Goods at Shipper\u2019s risk and expense or destroy such Goods without liability to Carrier EXPLOSIVES, DANGEROUS, OR HAZARDOUS GOODS The transportation of dangerous goods may be subject to federal, state, or municipal law. Section 9 contains the shipper\u2019s indemnification for damages arising from the shipment of hazardous materials. The motor carrier tariff typically contains the carrier\u2019s disclaimer of liability, a more detailed shipper\u2019s indemnification, an obligation on the shipper to inform the carrier of the nature of the goods, and additional detailed provisions relating to the prohibited or restricted items, including: - Animals. - Asbestos. - Explosives. - Guns. - Hazardous waste, including medical waste. 10. Substitute or Replacement Bill of Lading. If this Bill of Lading is issued on the order of Shipper or its agent, in exchange or in substitution for another bill of lading, Shipper\u2019s signature on the prior bill of lading as to the statement of value or otherwise, or election of common law or bill of lading liability will be considered a part of this Bill of Lading as fully as if the signature was made on this Bill of Lading. SEE NOTE [5] Transportation by Water. If all or any part of the Goods is carried by water over any part of the route, such water carriage shall be performed subject to the terms and provisions and limitations of liability specified by the \u201cCarriage of Goods by Sea Act\u201d and any other pertinent laws applicable to water carriers. SEE NOTE [6] Alterations and Additions. Any alteration, addition, or erasure in this Bill of Lading made without the special notation of Carrier will be without effect, and this Bill of Lading will be enforceable according to its original tenor. [1] LIABILITY OF CARRIER Sections 2(a) and (b) are consistent with the Carmack Amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act. The Carmack Amendment: Preempts any state law claims that a shipper may have against the carrier where the goods are damaged, lost, or untimely delivered in connection with the interstate shipment of goods. Provides the sole and exclusive remedy to shippers for loss or damage in interstate transit. Codified the common law rule that imposed near strict liability on freight carriers for damages to goods transported except where they can prove that the damages were caused by: - an Act of God, such as a hurricane or earthquake. - a public enemy, such as a person or entity that commits a terrorist act. - an act or default of the shipper, such as the failure of the shipper to properly pack the goods. - an act of a public authority, such as a quarantine or a road closure. an inherent vice or nature of the goods transported, such as spoilage of food, or spontaneous combustion of chemical cargo. (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14706.) Under the Carmack Amendment, a shipper that wants to hold a motor carrier liable for cargo damage must show: That the goods were in good condition when delivered to the carrier for shipment. That the goods were damaged when delivered (or lost before delivery). The amount of damages. (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14706.) Under the Carmack Amendment, motor carriers are liable for \u201cthe actual loss or injury to the property caused\u201d by the carrier, which typically is the difference between the market value of the property in the condition in which it should have arrived at its destination and its actual market 3. Transportation Schedule. Unless arranged or agreed upon, in writing, prior to shipment, Carrier is not required to transport a shipment by a particular schedule or by a particular date or time, but is responsible to transport the Goods with reasonable dispatch. In case of physical necessity, Carrier may forward a shipment via another carrier. 4. Claims. Carrier shall not be liable if a claim is not filed or a suit is not instituted thereon in accordance with the following provisions: (a) Claims for loss, damage, or delay must be filed in writing with any participating carrier having sufficient information to identify the shipment. (b) Claims for loss or damage must be filed within nine months after the delivery of the Goods (or, in the case of export traffic, within nine months after delivery at the port of export), except that claims for failure to make delivery must be filed within nine months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed. (c) Suits for loss, damage, injury, or delay shall be instituted against Carrier no later than two years and one day from the day when written notice is given by Carrier to the claimant that Carrier has disallowed the claim or any part or parts of the claim specified in the notice. (d) Carrier will have the full benefit of any insurance policies or contracts claimant has in effect on the Goods; provided that Carrier receiving the benefit of such insurance must reimburse the claimant for the premium paid on the insurance policy or contract. 5. Goods not Delivered. (a) If Consignee refuses the shipment tendered for delivery by Carrier or if Carrier is unable to deliver the Goods, because of fault or mistake of Shipper or Consignee, Carrier\u2019s liability shall then become that of a warehouseman. Carrier shall promptly attempt to provide notice, by telephonic or electronic communication as provided on the face of this Bill of Lading, if so indicated, to Shipper or the party, if any, designated to receive notice on this Bill of Lading. Storage charges, based on Carrier\u2019s tariff, shall start no sooner than the next business day following the attempted notification. Storage may be, at Carrier\u2019s option, in any location that provides reasonable protection against loss or damage. Carrier may place the shipment in public storage at Shipper\u2019s expense and without liability to the Carrier. value in the condition in which it did arrive. The Carmack Amendment, however, allows the carrier to limit its liability by including a limitation of liability provision, such as that provided in Section 6 (and supplemented by the extensive pro-carrier limitation of liability provisions typically found in the applicable motor carrier tariff). [2] GOODS NOT DELIVERED This provision provides contractual exceptions for liability of the carrier to deliver the goods that are similar to the exceptions provided a common carrier in the Federal Act, which covers: Delivery compelled by legal process. Goods sold lawfully to satisfy the carrier\u2019s lien. Goods that have not been claimed. Goods that are perishable or hazardous. (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 80111(d).) [3] FREIGHT CHARGES Under the Carmack Amendment, a carrier can adopt a tariff that is applied to shipping rates based on: - The weight of the goods. - The value of the goods. - The mileage required to transport the goods. - The amount of liability that the carrier is willing to incur for cargo loss or damage (see Section 6). - The carrier typically supplements this provision with detailed provisions in its motor carrier tariff regarding: - Payment terms, including collection fees, service charges, and other fees for delayed payment, non-payment, or returned check. - The right to withhold delivery for delayed payment or non-payment. - Freight fees that apply if the shipment originates from or is destined to specified high cost zip codes, such as the Borough of Manhattan. - Any fuel surcharge imposed based on fuel reports of the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) or other criteria. - Additional fees for special services, for example: (i) refrigerated transportation; and (ii) expedited or express service. - Minimum charges for shipments, whether based on volume, density, or other criteria. - Rates and procedures relating to \u201ccollect on delivery (COD)\u201d and prepaid shipments. [4] ITEMS OF EXTRAORDINARY VALUE The transportation of valuables may be subject to federal, state, or municipal law. The motor carrier tariff typically contains the carrier\u2019s disclaimer of liability, the shipper\u2019s indemnification, and additional detailed provisions relating to the transportation of valuables, including: - Antiques. - Artwork. - Currency. - Jewelry. [5] SUBSTITUTE OR REPLACEMENT BILL OF LADING This provision establishes that in the situation where a substitute or replacement bill of lading is issued, for purposes of determining liability the shipper\u2019s declaration of value or election of liability on the original bill of lading continues to apply regarding the substitute bill of lading. [6] TRANSPORTATION BY WATER Special rules apply to water carriage. For example the Carmack Amendment provides that the liability of a water carrier is determined by its bill of lading and the law applicable to water transportation. Common carriers engaged in the transportation of property other than livestock and wild animals by water that are subject to the Interstate Commerce Act, must use bills of lading prescribed by 49 C.F.R. Section 1035.1(a). The Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA) is automatically enforced in international transportation of goods, but not in transportation of goods domestically unless the carrier agrees to be bound by the COGSA (46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7\u00a7 1300 to 1315 (1997)). The COGSA generally provides that a ship owner\u2019s liability is limited to $500 per shipping package and it stipulates a one-year time limit for filing suit against the Carrier. Notices Motor Carrier Tariff Federal law requires motor carriers to maintain a written or electronic copy of the \u201crates, classifications, rules and practices\u201d that apply to its shipments (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13710). This bill of lading conforms to federal law and with industry practice by providing that the shipment is subject to the rates, classifications, and rules that have been established by the carrier in a separate motor carrier tariff. Carriers also maintain tariffs to set out a variety of pro-carrier risk allocation provisions that they want to enforce against all shippers. Some of these are discussed below in the drafting notes of the corresponding bill of lading provisions. Federal law requires applicable carriers to give the shipper a copy of the tariff on request (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13710(a)(1)). There is no requirement that a tariff be publicly accessible to be part of an enforceable contract between the shipper and the carrier. Many carriers, however, make their tariffs publicly available on their websites. Because the carrier drafts both the bill of lading and the motor carrier tariff, it should ensure that there is no conflict between the two documents. However, the carrier may want to specify in the tariff, that in the event of a conflict, the tariff controls. However, the shipper typically wishes the bill of lading to control because the bill of lading is the document it is signing (and may modify). In most cases, the carrier is likely to agree to specify in the bill of lading that in the event of a conflict the bill of lading controls over the tariff. Governing Law and Forum Bills of lading are generally governed by The Federal Bills of Lading Act (Federal Act) (49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 80101 - 80116), as well as Article 7 of the UCC, as enacted by the relevant state. Because both UCC Article 7 and court cases interpreting Article 7 can vary from state to state, counsel should always refer to the law of the specific jurisdiction governing the transaction. UCC Article 7 supplements, but is generally consistent with, the Federal Act. Generally motor carrier tariffs require the shipper to submit to exclusive arbitration, subject to any exception for arbitrability. Tariffs sometimes also make exceptions allowing claimants to bring small claims in small claims courts or other courts of limited jurisdiction.","title":"Non-Negotiable Bill of Lading"},{"location":"bill-of-lading/non-negotiable-bol/#non-negotiable-bill-of-lading","text":"","title":"Non-Negotiable Bill of Lading"},{"location":"bill-of-lading/non-negotiable-bol/#1-applicability","text":"${NAME OF CARRIER} (\u201cCarrier\u201d) shall provide transportation, handling, delivery, and related services (the \u201cServices\u201d) for the goods described on the face side hereof (the \u201cGoods\u201d) on behalf of the shipper named on the face side hereof (\u201cShipper\u201d).

[1] LIABILITY OF CARRIER Sections 2(a) and (b) are consistent with the Carmack Amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act. The Carmack Amendment: Preempts any state law claims that a shipper may have against the carrier where the goods are damaged, lost, or untimely delivered in connection with the interstate shipment of goods. Provides the sole and exclusive remedy to shippers for loss or damage in interstate transit. Codified the common law rule that imposed near strict liability on freight carriers for damages to goods transported except where they can prove that the damages were caused by: - an Act of God, such as a hurricane or earthquake. - a public enemy, such as a person or entity that commits a terrorist act. - an act or default of the shipper, such as the failure of the shipper to properly pack the goods. - an act of a public authority, such as a quarantine or a road closure. an inherent vice or nature of the goods transported, such as spoilage of food, or spontaneous combustion of chemical cargo. (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14706.) Under the Carmack Amendment, a shipper that wants to hold a motor carrier liable for cargo damage must show: That the goods were in good condition when delivered to the carrier for shipment. That the goods were damaged when delivered (or lost before delivery). The amount of damages. (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14706.) Under the Carmack Amendment, motor carriers are liable for \u201cthe actual loss or injury to the property caused\u201d by the carrier, which typically is the difference between the market value of the property in the condition in which it should have arrived at its destination and its actual market 3. Transportation Schedule. Unless arranged or agreed upon, in writing, prior to shipment, Carrier is not required to transport a shipment by a particular schedule or by a particular date or time, but is responsible to transport the Goods with reasonable dispatch. In case of physical necessity, Carrier may forward a shipment via another carrier. 4. Claims. Carrier shall not be liable if a claim is not filed or a suit is not instituted thereon in accordance with the following provisions: (a) Claims for loss, damage, or delay must be filed in writing with any participating carrier having sufficient information to identify the shipment. (b) Claims for loss or damage must be filed within nine months after the delivery of the Goods (or, in the case of export traffic, within nine months after delivery at the port of export), except that claims for failure to make delivery must be filed within nine months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed. (c) Suits for loss, damage, injury, or delay shall be instituted against Carrier no later than two years and one day from the day when written notice is given by Carrier to the claimant that Carrier has disallowed the claim or any part or parts of the claim specified in the notice. (d) Carrier will have the full benefit of any insurance policies or contracts claimant has in effect on the Goods; provided that Carrier receiving the benefit of such insurance must reimburse the claimant for the premium paid on the insurance policy or contract. 5. Goods not Delivered. (a) If Consignee refuses the shipment tendered for delivery by Carrier or if Carrier is unable to deliver the Goods, because of fault or mistake of Shipper or Consignee, Carrier\u2019s liability shall then become that of a warehouseman. Carrier shall promptly attempt to provide notice, by telephonic or electronic communication as provided on the face of this Bill of Lading, if so indicated, to Shipper or the party, if any, designated to receive notice on this Bill of Lading. Storage charges, based on Carrier\u2019s tariff, shall start no sooner than the next business day following the attempted notification. Storage may be, at Carrier\u2019s option, in any location that provides reasonable protection against loss or damage. Carrier may place the shipment in public storage at Shipper\u2019s expense and without liability to the Carrier. value in the condition in which it did arrive. The Carmack Amendment, however, allows the carrier to limit its liability by including a limitation of liability provision, such as that provided in Section 6 (and supplemented by the extensive pro-carrier limitation of liability provisions typically found in the applicable motor carrier tariff). [2] GOODS NOT DELIVERED This provision provides contractual exceptions for liability of the carrier to deliver the goods that are similar to the exceptions provided a common carrier in the Federal Act, which covers: Delivery compelled by legal process. Goods sold lawfully to satisfy the carrier\u2019s lien. Goods that have not been claimed. Goods that are perishable or hazardous. (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 80111(d).) [3] FREIGHT CHARGES Under the Carmack Amendment, a carrier can adopt a tariff that is applied to shipping rates based on: - The weight of the goods. - The value of the goods. - The mileage required to transport the goods. - The amount of liability that the carrier is willing to incur for cargo loss or damage (see Section 6). - The carrier typically supplements this provision with detailed provisions in its motor carrier tariff regarding: - Payment terms, including collection fees, service charges, and other fees for delayed payment, non-payment, or returned check. - The right to withhold delivery for delayed payment or non-payment. - Freight fees that apply if the shipment originates from or is destined to specified high cost zip codes, such as the Borough of Manhattan. - Any fuel surcharge imposed based on fuel reports of the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) or other criteria. - Additional fees for special services, for example: (i) refrigerated transportation; and (ii) expedited or express service. - Minimum charges for shipments, whether based on volume, density, or other criteria. - Rates and procedures relating to \u201ccollect on delivery (COD)\u201d and prepaid shipments. [4] ITEMS OF EXTRAORDINARY VALUE The transportation of valuables may be subject to federal, state, or municipal law. The motor carrier tariff typically contains the carrier\u2019s disclaimer of liability, the shipper\u2019s indemnification, and additional detailed provisions relating to the transportation of valuables, including: - Antiques. - Artwork. - Currency. - Jewelry. [5] SUBSTITUTE OR REPLACEMENT BILL OF LADING This provision establishes that in the situation where a substitute or replacement bill of lading is issued, for purposes of determining liability the shipper\u2019s declaration of value or election of liability on the original bill of lading continues to apply regarding the substitute bill of lading. [6] TRANSPORTATION BY WATER Special rules apply to water carriage. For example the Carmack Amendment provides that the liability of a water carrier is determined by its bill of lading and the law applicable to water transportation. Common carriers engaged in the transportation of property other than livestock and wild animals by water that are subject to the Interstate Commerce Act, must use bills of lading prescribed by 49 C.F.R. Section 1035.1(a). The Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA) is automatically enforced in international transportation of goods, but not in transportation of goods domestically unless the carrier agrees to be bound by the COGSA (46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7\u00a7 1300 to 1315 (1997)). The COGSA generally provides that a ship owner\u2019s liability is limited to $500 per shipping package and it stipulates a one-year time limit for filing suit against the Carrier.","title":"10.

This bill of lading conforms to federal law and with industry practice by providing that the shipment is subject to the rates, classifications, and rules that have been established by the carrier in a separate motor carrier tariff. Carriers also maintain tariffs to set out a variety of pro-carrier risk allocation provisions that they want to enforce against all shippers. Some of these are discussed below in the drafting notes of the corresponding bill of lading provisions. Federal law requires applicable carriers to give the shipper a copy of the tariff on request (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13710(a)(1)). There is no requirement that a tariff be publicly accessible to be part of an enforceable contract between the shipper and the carrier. Many carriers, however, make their tariffs publicly available on their websites. Because the carrier drafts both the bill of lading and the motor carrier tariff, it should ensure that there is no conflict between the two documents. However, the carrier may want to specify in the tariff, that in the event of a conflict, the tariff controls. However, the shipper typically wishes the bill of lading to control because the bill of lading is the document it is signing (and may modify). In most cases, the carrier is likely to agree to specify in the bill of lading that in the event of a conflict the bill of lading controls over the tariff. Governing Law and Forum Bills of lading are generally governed by The Federal Bills of Lading Act (Federal Act) (49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 80101 - 80116), as well as Article 7 of the UCC, as enacted by the relevant state. Because both UCC Article 7 and court cases interpreting Article 7 can vary from state to state, counsel should always refer to the law of the specific jurisdiction governing the transaction. UCC Article 7 supplements, but is generally consistent with, the Federal Act. Generally motor carrier tariffs require the shipper to submit to exclusive arbitration, subject to any exception for arbitrability. Tariffs sometimes also make exceptions allowing claimants to bring small claims in small claims courts or other courts of limited jurisdiction.","title":"Motor Carrier Tariff"},{"location":"bill-of-lading/transporation-master-agreement-pro-shipper/","text":"@title: Transporation Master Agreement Pro Shipper @version: 19.25 @param: [DATE] [STATE OF ORGANIZATION] [CARRIER NAME] [TYPE OF ENTITY] [CUSTOMER NAME] [NUMBER] @(of months) [parcel/less-than-truckload/full truckload] [LIST OF EXCEPTIONS] @(risk of loss) Transportation Agreement This Transportation Agreement, dated as of [DATE] (this \u201cAgreement\u201d), is entered into between [CARRIER NAME], a [STATE OF ORGANIZATION] [TYPE OF ENTITY] (\u201cCarrier\u201d), and [CUSTOMER NAME], a [STATE OF ORGANIZATION] [TYPE OF ENTITY] ([on its own behalf and on behalf of its affiliated and subsidiary companies] \u201cCustomer\u201d, and together with Carrier, the \u201cParties\u201d, and each, a \u201cParty\u201d).

SEE NOTE [3] SHIPPMENT REQUESTS 400. Shipment and Delivery. 4.1 Shipment and Delivery. [Unless otherwise expressly agreed to by the Parties in any Individual Shipment Transaction,] Carrier shall deliver the Shipment to the Delivery Location [[by/no later than [NUMBER] days after] the delivery date specified in the Basic Shipment Terms].

Carrier shall be liable to Customer for the full actual loss, damage or injury to the Goods occurring while in the custody, possession or control of Carrier, or resulting from Carrier\u2019s performance of or failure to perform the Transportation Services, incurred by Customer as a result thereof[; provided, however, that Carrier shall not be liable for loss of or damage or injury to the Goods if such loss, damage or injury was caused by any [Force Majeure Event, except [LIST OF EXCEPTIONS]/acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake or explosion, war, invasion, hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorist threats or acts, riot or other civil unrest], or [was solely/to the extent] the fault of Customer.] 5.2 Loss Amount. Subject to Section 5.1, if a Shipment or any part thereof is lost, damaged, or injured, Carrier shall pay to Customer the price charged by Customer to its customers for the kind and quantity of Goods lost, damaged, or injured and all taxes, fees, and other charges of any kind or nature which Customer may have paid or may be required to pay or collect in respect of such Goods or their manufacture, storage, distribution, transportation, or sale. Customer shall deduct from any invoice to Carrier the reasonable salvage value of any damaged Goods that have been returned to Customer; provided, however, that Customer shall not be obligated to make any such deduction for, or to surrender to Carrier, any Shipment or portion thereof which Customer has destroyed or agrees to destroy because[, pursuant to the provisions of any applicable Law or any written or unwritten trade or industry standard or practice/in Customer\u2019s [sole/reasonable] judgment], the Goods have been rendered unfit or unsuitable for sale, use, or consumption due to spoilage, contamination, or adulteration in transit or a reasonable suspicion thereof. 5.3 [Claim Procedure. Customer shall submit to Carrier a written claim for loss, damage, or injury to any Shipment within [NUMBER] days after delivery at the Delivery Location of the Shipment with respect to which such claim is made or, in case of failure to make such delivery, within [NUMBER] months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed. Carrier agrees to pay each such claim within [NUMBER] days of its receipt thereof or, within such period, to notify Customer in writing that such claim is disallowed and setting forth in reasonable detail the reasons for such disallowance. [This provision shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement for a period of [NUMBER] months after such expiration or termination. Notwithstanding any right under any applicable statute of limitations to bring a claim under this Section 5, no Action based on or arising in any way out of this provision may be brought by either Party after the expiration of the applicable survival or other period set forth in this provision and the Parties waive the right to file any such Action after the expiration of the applicable survival or other period.]] SEE NOTE [5] 600. Insurance. 6.1 Requirement to Obtain Insurance. Carrier shall procure and keep in force continuously [during the Term] the following types of insurance: (a) Commercial general liability insurance, including blanket contractual coverage, for bodily injury and property damage in the amount of US$[AMOUNT] combined single limit per occurrence. > SEE NOTE [6] TRANSPORTATION SERVICES This Standard Document sets out a basic definition of the services to be provided by the carrier. The parties must revise this definition (or use a different form of agreement) if the carrier will provide additional or specialized services, for example: - Temporary warehouse services. - Rail transportation. - Air transportation. - Waterway transportation. - Pipeline transportation. - Refrigerated transportation. - Expedited service. [2] PROVISION OF TRANSPORT SERVIES This Document acknowledges that carriers employ a variety of order and acceptance procedures, which may include: Manually implemented systems utilizing the customer\u2019s shipment request and carrier\u2019s acceptances. Either the carrier\u2019s or customer\u2019s electronic data platform. When the carrier agrees to provide the transportation services at its cost and expense, it is agreeing to assume all costs and expenses incident to the transportation of shipments. This includes all costs of fuel and insurance, as well as incident to or arising out of the maintenance, repair or operation of its trucks and other equipment. If there are any out-of-pocket or other costs that are not covered as overhead by the purchase price of the transportation services, and which the carrier would like to pass along to the customer (for example, any fuel surcharge), it must be sure to clarify the allocation in Section 8. SUBCONTRACTING: The parties must negotiate: Whether to allow the carrier to subcontract some or all of the transportation services. If the parties allow the carrier to subcontract: how much discretion the carrier has in its choice of subcontractor; and the conditions that must be satisfied. [3] Carrier\u2019s Right to Reject Shipment Requests This pro-customer Standard Document does not give the carrier the right to reject shipment requests. The customer can expect the carrier to negotiate the right to accept or reject shipment requests. If the customer agrees to give the carrier the right to reject shipment requests, it should negotiate to restrict the carrier\u2019s discretion based on objective criteria, for example: The customer\u2019s credit status. The size of the request. Whether the carrier has the capacity. In addition, the customer may want to require the carrier to: Accept the shipment request within a certain period of time. Notify the customer in writing of any rejection or cancellation within a certain period of time. [5] CARRIER BEARS RISK OF LOSS In this provision, the carrier undertakes to bear the entire risk of loss, damage or injury to the goods. Since the carrier bears the risk of loss, it must compensate the customer for any loss either: Directly. Through the proceeds of any cargo insurance maintained by the carrier under Section 6.1(b). The bracketed language anticipates that the carrier will attempt to limit its liability by excluding loss, damage or injury resulting from acts beyond its control. The parties can define the acts beyond the carrier\u2019s control either by: Referencing to the definition of Force Majeure Event. Listing the acts specifically. [6] Insurance coverage enables: The carrier to mitigate its financial exposure to the specified risk by shifting the risk to its insurer, in exchange for an insurance premium that usually represents a fraction of the total coverage the policy provides. The customer to limit its risk that the carrier does not have the financial capacity to cover its liabilities under the contract. This Standard Document assumes that the carrier is a contract carrier, which is not required to maintain all types of insurance. However, this Standard Document aims to be reasonable by imposing the contractual requirement that the carrier procure and maintain at least: * Liability insurance (see Section 6.1(a)). * Property insurance (see Section 6.1(b).) Deductibles. A policy that has a deductible reduces the total amount of coverage provided by the policy by the amount of the deductible. For example, an insurance policy providing $200,000 in coverage with a $10,000 deductible would cover $190,000 worth of any loss suffered by the policyholder in excess of the $10,000 deductible. SIRs. A SIR does not reduce policy limits, but must be satisfied before the policy limits can be tapped. A policy that has a SIR requires the policyholder to incur a loss in excess of the SIR amount before coverage is triggered, but will then cover up to the full amount of coverage. For example, a $200,000 insurance policy with a $10,000 SIR would provide a full $200,000 worth of coverage after the policyholder had paid $10,000 to satisfy the SIR.","title":"200.

The parties must revise this definition (or use a different form of agreement) if the carrier will provide additional or specialized services, for example: - Temporary warehouse services. - Rail transportation. - Air transportation. - Waterway transportation. - Pipeline transportation. - Refrigerated transportation. - Expedited service. [2] PROVISION OF TRANSPORT SERVIES This Document acknowledges that carriers employ a variety of order and acceptance procedures, which may include: Manually implemented systems utilizing the customer\u2019s shipment request and carrier\u2019s acceptances. Either the carrier\u2019s or customer\u2019s electronic data platform. When the carrier agrees to provide the transportation services at its cost and expense, it is agreeing to assume all costs and expenses incident to the transportation of shipments. This includes all costs of fuel and insurance, as well as incident to or arising out of the maintenance, repair or operation of its trucks and other equipment. If there are any out-of-pocket or other costs that are not covered as overhead by the purchase price of the transportation services, and which the carrier would like to pass along to the customer (for example, any fuel surcharge), it must be sure to clarify the allocation in Section 8. SUBCONTRACTING: The parties must negotiate: Whether to allow the carrier to subcontract some or all of the transportation services. If the parties allow the carrier to subcontract: how much discretion the carrier has in its choice of subcontractor; and the conditions that must be satisfied. [3] Carrier\u2019s Right to Reject Shipment Requests This pro-customer Standard Document does not give the carrier the right to reject shipment requests. The customer can expect the carrier to negotiate the right to accept or reject shipment requests. If the customer agrees to give the carrier the right to reject shipment requests, it should negotiate to restrict the carrier\u2019s discretion based on objective criteria, for example: The customer\u2019s credit status. The size of the request. Whether the carrier has the capacity. In addition, the customer may want to require the carrier to: Accept the shipment request within a certain period of time. Notify the customer in writing of any rejection or cancellation within a certain period of time. [5] CARRIER BEARS RISK OF LOSS In this provision, the carrier undertakes to bear the entire risk of loss, damage or injury to the goods. Since the carrier bears the risk of loss, it must compensate the customer for any loss either: Directly. Through the proceeds of any cargo insurance maintained by the carrier under Section 6.1(b). The bracketed language anticipates that the carrier will attempt to limit its liability by excluding loss, damage or injury resulting from acts beyond its control. The parties can define the acts beyond the carrier\u2019s control either by: Referencing to the definition of Force Majeure Event. Listing the acts specifically. [6] Insurance coverage enables: The carrier to mitigate its financial exposure to the specified risk by shifting the risk to its insurer, in exchange for an insurance premium that usually represents a fraction of the total coverage the policy provides. The customer to limit its risk that the carrier does not have the financial capacity to cover its liabilities under the contract. This Standard Document assumes that the carrier is a contract carrier, which is not required to maintain all types of insurance. However, this Standard Document aims to be reasonable by imposing the contractual requirement that the carrier procure and maintain at least: * Liability insurance (see Section 6.1(a)). * Property insurance (see Section 6.1(b).) Deductibles. A policy that has a deductible reduces the total amount of coverage provided by the policy by the amount of the deductible. For example, an insurance policy providing $200,000 in coverage with a $10,000 deductible would cover $190,000 worth of any loss suffered by the policyholder in excess of the $10,000 deductible. SIRs. A SIR does not reduce policy limits, but must be satisfied before the policy limits can be tapped. A policy that has a SIR requires the policyholder to incur a loss in excess of the SIR amount before coverage is triggered, but will then cover up to the full amount of coverage. For example, a $200,000 insurance policy with a $10,000 SIR would provide a full $200,000 worth of coverage after the policyholder had paid $10,000 to satisfy the SIR.","title":"TRANSPORTATION SERVICES"},{"location":"blockchain/demateralizing-process/","text":"Dematerializing Supply Chain Documents (a) Negotiable Bills (1) A bill of lading is negotiable if the bill\u2014 (A) states that the goods are to be delivered to the order of a consignee; and (B) does not contain on its face an agreement with the shipper that the bill is not negotiable.

If you choose to implement the bar coding of the BOL number and/or SCAC and Pro# for a carrier, be sure that the carrier is aware of the above requirements. Bills of Lading have 3 groups: Master, FTL and LTL LTL Rules of Use for the Standard Bill of Lading source: VICS BOL Standard The guidelines to the Bill of Lading are designed so that the U.S. industry may benefit from a form that is consistent and understandable. The standard VICS BOL is intended for U.S. LTL and TL ground transport. It is particularly critical that all businesses using the form adhere to its design so that the supply chain may take advantage of these benefits. Listed below is additional detail regarding the use of the standard Bill of Lading. Adjustments to the VICS Bill of Lading can be made based on the following guidelines: The geographical placement of data and data descriptions must be kept intact according to this standard. This is important to ensure that all parties within the supply chain will know where to locate the specific information they need. Each section or data description area may be modified to fit the supply chain business requirements as follows: \u2022 Spacing \u2022 Column width \u2022 Row height \u2022 Removal of the data lines in the Customer and Carrier Information sections when either the form or data is computer printed. \u2022 When the form is loaded into a software program, all sections shall be clearly identified and the appropriate form lines and headings must be present. \u2022 To support North America cross boarder ground shipments, the section headings can be modified to include bilingual wording. Note: If cube information is being provided, the cube data column should be inserted between the Weight and Pallet/Slip column in the Customer Order Section. The following data must be 12-point Bold: a) Bill of Lading number c) Ship to Location number b) SCAC/Pro number d) Customer Order Number When printing processes do not allow for variances in point size and bolding, the above data must be displayed with adequate spacing and high quality printing to support ease of recognition and data entry by the carriers. The CID number shall be in 10-point and bolded. All other data input items may be in a 10-point or smaller (See Section I Page 3 & 4 on legal statements), no bolding. Printing: The standard Bill of Lading may be duplicated and printed in multiple part forms by any printing company or shipper. If the Supplement page is used, the best practice has been to print the Supplement page(s) first, then print the front Bill of Lading page with the Grand Totals last. The Bill of Lading page must then be placed in front of the Supplement page(s). Pagination: In general, each bill of lading (including any supplement pages) and attachments are considered separate documents. For example: a) BOL with 3 supplement pages: BOL = page 1, Supplement = pages 2, 3 and 4 b) Master BOL with 2 underlying BOL\u2019s; underlying BOL\u2019s with 2 supplement pages: Master BOL = page 1, First underlying BOL = page 1, supplement pages = 2, 3 Second underlying BOL = page 1, supplement pages =2, 3. c) BOL with an attachment (e.g., packing list and /or shipping manifest): BOL = page 1, attachment one = pages 1, 2\u2026, attachment two = pages 1, 2\u2026. IV. Rules of Use for the Standard Bill of Lading 14 The Bill of Lading is not to be used as a packing list; the packing list is to be on a separate document. In addition, the following items are not part of the Bill of Lading and shall not be included on the Bill of Lading. However, these documents are considered as potential attachments to the Bill of Lading. \u2022 Packing List line item information. \u2022 Shipping Manifest - The Shipping Manifest is a document generated by the shipper for a customer pertaining to store shipments that are shipped to a customer specified intermediate location (i.e., distribution center, consolidator) with the individual cartons marked for specific store locations. The manifest contains store level detail that typically includes store location numbers, store addresses, customer order numbers, number of cartons per order per store and weight/cube totals. \u2022 Hazardous Item List (See Section VII. Hazardous Materials Regulations for instructions) !!! note See Appendix E for recommended format, detailed data content explanation and examples. The Canadian PARS sticker for customs belongs on the freight invoice, not on the Bill of Lading. The information conveyed through EDI (e.g. EDI 856, 204, 211, 214) shall be consistent with the information on the paper Bill of Lading. This in no way implies that all information conveyed through any one EDI document will map one-to- one to the paper Bill of Lading. When using the Supplement Page to list customer order number and commodity information, state \u201cSee attached Bill of Lading Supplement\u201d in the body of the first page and begin listing the information on the supplement page. Only the grand total of the cartons and weight for the shipment will be detailed on the first page. No Bill of Lading information shall be placed on the back of the Bill of Lading page. This area is reserved for the terms and conditions of the contract on the preprinted forms. Additional printing considerations and options. A. Data tags can be used in the Customer Order Information Section to identify multiple data elements that may be required by the consignee Use of Master Bill of Lading 16 A Master Bill of Lading is created for three shipment scenarios: Consolidation shipments Invoice per Bill of Lading per customer order Truckload shipments with multiple stops For these scenarios, the purpose of the Master Bill of Lading is to tie the underlying Bills of Lading together into one shipment for freight rating and billing purposes. The standard Bill of Lading is used as a Master Bill of Lading by checking the \u201cMaster Bill of Lading\u201d indicator box. The underlying Bill of Lading numbers shall be referenced in the Special Instructions field on the Master Bill of Lading. The Master Bill of Lading number shall be referenced in the Special Instructions field on the underlying Bills of Lading. The development of the Supplement Page to the Bill of Lading eliminates the use of a Master Bill of Lading for the purpose of needing more lines to fit all the information on one page (see section V) t The Master Bill of Lading shall not be used for this purpose. Often a Master Bill of Lading, with underlying Bills of Lading attached, is used in conjunction with the 856 Ship Notice Manifest and the 214 Carrier Shipment Status EDI transaction sets. In this case, the Master Bill of Lading number is the number that is transmitted on the EDI transaction sets representing that shipment. Do not transmit the underlying Bill of Lading numbers as that causes confusion as to which Bill of Lading number is the one to be used. The use of a Master Bill of Lading is a complex aspect of shipping that may be better shown by example.","title":"Dematerializing Supply Chain Documents"},{"location":"blockchain/demateralizing-process/#dematerializing-supply-chain-documents","text":"(a) Negotiable Bills (1) A bill of lading is negotiable if the bill\u2014 (A) states that the goods are to be delivered to the order of a consignee; and (B) does not contain on its face an agreement with the shipper that the bill is not negotiable.

Program code is stored in a ROM, not easily accessible Jumps A JUMP or JUMPI instruction sets the program counter and therefore starts execution off again from some newly- specified instruction. These must jump to some explicit JUMPDEST instruction, that is not an argument literal of another instruction. Exceptions There is only one type of exception. If one occurs, return to the state prior to the current execution, but consume all gas. Exceptions may occur in any of the following circumstances: There is insufficient remaining gas to cover the cost of an instruction; An undefined instruction is to be executed; A jump to an invalid destination occurs. The stack size would exceed 1024 if the next instruction were to be executed Fees Gas fees may be charged for the following reasons: Intrinsic fees charged for computation performed by each instruction gas may be deducted to pay for a subordinate contract call or creation gas may be paid to compensate for extra memory usage Execution Environment The currently executing contract has access to a tuple I , with the following fields: I_a : the address of the account owning the executing code I_o : the address of the transaction originating this execution I_p : the gas price in the originating transaction I_d : a byte array of the input data I_s : sender address I_v : the value (in wei) passed to this account I_b : the byte array containing the machine code to be executed I_H : the current block header I_e : the current contract stack depth (number of CALL and CREATE instructions that have been executed) The memory state \u03bc , of the currently running contract, is itself subdivided thus: \u03bc_s : the stack, holds up to 1024 words; initially empty \u03bc_m : memory contents, initially implicitly 2^256 bytes of zeroes (word-addressed byte array, words stored big-endian); \u03bc_g : remaining gas \u03bc_pc : The program counter (a positive 256 bit integer) \u03bc_i : the size of the active memory region in words We also have a substate A, maintained during execution, which contains the following fields (initially empty or zero): A_s : The suicide set. Accounts to be discarded following transaction completion. A_l : Log series. archived and indexable \"checkpoints\" that help contract calls to be tracked. A_r : Refund balance, accrued by setting nonzero values in \u03c3 to zero, using the SSTORE instruction.

Instructions Definitions \u03bc : the EVM's memory; by a slight overloading of terms, this shall mean the same thing as \u03bc_m , above. If a value v is said to be saved to memory at address \u03b1, this means \u03bc[\u03b1] <- v. If v is a word, it is saved in big- endian order in the address range [\u03b1, \u03b1 + 31]. \u03c4 : the EVM's execution stack; the same thing as \u03bc_s , above. We have \u03c4[0] the top stack element, and \u03c4[k] the element k from the top. If an instruction pops m values off the stack and pushes n values onto it, this behaviour will be denoted -m+n in the table. The size of the stack aer an operation is then (n - m). The result of operations is usually pushed to the stack. \u03c1 : the persistent storage available to the executing account. This is equivalent to \u03c3 [ I_a ].

(Price and Ethereum Main Network) Abstract The VBSM is an implementation of the Viable Systems Model for decentralized blockchain networks with an emphasis on autonomy, viability, and stability In reaching a viable state, defined terms and sub-systems must be formalized and specified. This section of documentation is an effort in trying to formalize such goals, objectives and key results that can be achieved when a systems based approach is combined with formal design and mechanisms to achive said goals.

System 2 Deals with the inevitable problems which emerge as a number of autonomous, self-organising operational parts interact. There will be conflicts of interest which must be resolved. System 2 is there to harmonise the interactions, to keep the peace, to deal with the problems. Without a System 2, the system would shake itself to pieces. System 3 Concerned with synergy. It looks at the entire interacting cluster of operational units from its meta-systemic perspective and considers ways to maximise its effectiveness through collaboration. System 3 ensures the whole system works better than the operational parts working in isolation. It represents all of the structures that are put in place by senior leadership to dictate rules, rights, resources and responsibilities within System 1, and also to provide an interface for interaction with Systems 4 and 5. This system represents the broad view of all the operations active within the first system. In simple terms, it is the everyday control of the organisation which is exerted by senior leaders. There is little variety within the activities which occur within the third system. System 4 Ensures the whole system can adapt to a rapidly changing and sometimes hostile environment. It scans the outside world in which it operates, looks for threats and opportunities, undertakes research and simulations, and proposes plans to guide the system through the various possible pathways it could follow. Without a System 4, the system would be unable to cope with the complexity of the external environment in which it operates. In essence it is responsible for looking externally from the organisation or overall system, at the environment in which it operates, and establishing which factors may impact operations, and how it needs to adapt in order to remain viable and sustainable. There are also channels leading each way between System 4 and System 3, as any necessary changes must be implemented through flow down towards the Control systems, but also System 3 must provide information regarding the organisation in its current form. This allows System 4 to formulate a clear model containing both the organisation and the environment, which forms the basis of adaptive strategie System 5 Provides closure to the whole system. It defines and develops the vision and values of the system through policies. System 5 creates the identity, the ethos, the ground rules under which everyone operates. It aligns the tasks of everyone in the organisation. This is the system which holds the overall control, though not necessarily directly, as it forms the culture and values of the organisation, and thus dictates policy decisions that control all of the below systems. This system should always be maintained as separate from the control exerted by System 3. System 5 monitors the interaction between S3 and S4 to ensure all plans are within policy guidelines. If not, it steps in and applies its ultimate authority. [RuleBook, Weighted Governance Board] Systems 1, 2 and 3 between them make up the internal environment of the viable system \u2013 the Inside and Now. The autonomous parts function in a harmonising internal environment which maximises its effectiveness through creating mutually supportive relationships.

At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the place (if any), date and time of the adjourned meeting and the means of remote communications (if any) by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. 2.8.Organization; Conduct of Business Such person as the Board of Directors may have designated or, in the absence of such a person, the chief executive officer, or in his or her absence, the president or, in his or her absence, such person as may be chosen by the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, shall call to order any meeting of the stockholders and act as chairperson of the meeting. In the absence of the secretary of the corporation, the secretary of the meeting shall be such person as the chairperson of the meeting appoints. The chairperson of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including the manner of voting and the conduct of business. The date and time of opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at the meeting shall be announced at the meeting. 2.9.Voting The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.12 of these bylaws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock and to voting trusts and other voting agreements). Except as may be otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder. All elections shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast, and except as otherwise required by law, all other matters shall be determined by a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively. 2.10.Waiver Of Notice Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, or waiver by electronic mail or other electronic transmission by such person, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice, or any waiver of notice by electronic transmission, unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws. 2.11.Stockholder Action By Written Consent Without A Meeting Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation, or any action that may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is (a) signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted, and (b) delivered to the corporation in accordance with Section 228(a) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the date the earliest dated consent is delivered to the corporation, a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take action are delivered to the corporation in the manner prescribed in this Section. A telegram, cablegram, electronic mail or other electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a stockholder or proxyholder, or by a person or persons authorized to act for a stockholder or proxyholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and dated for purposes of this Section to the extent permitted by law. Any such consent shall be delivered in accordance with Section 228(d)(1) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any and all purposes for which the original writing could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing (including by electronic mail or other electronic transmission as permitted by law). If the action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any section of the Delaware General Corporation Law if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, then the certificate filed under such section shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such section concerning any vote of stockholders, that written notice and written consent have been given as provided in Section 228 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. 2.12.Record Date For Stockholder Notice; Voting; Giving Consents In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting, nor more than 60 days prior to any other action. If the Board of Directors does not so fix a record date: a. The record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. b. The record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is necessary, shall be the day on which the first written consent (including consent by electronic mail or other electronic transmission as permitted by law) is delivered to the corporation. c. The record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting, if such adjournment is for 30 days or less; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. 2.13.Proxies Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by an instrument in writing or by an electronic transmission permitted by law filed with the secretary of the corporation, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, facsimile, electronic or telegraphic transmission or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(e) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. ARTICLE III DIRECTORS 3.1.Powers Subject to the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and any limitations in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws relating to action required to be approved by the stockholders or by the outstanding shares, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the Board of Directors. 3.2.Number Of Directors The number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors is one (1). This number may be changed by a resolution of the Board of Directors or of the stockholders, subject to Section 3.4 of these bylaws. No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director before such director's term of office expires. 3.3.Election, Qualification And Term Of Office Of Directors Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws, and unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders to hold office until the next annual meeting. Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, wherein other qualifications for directors may be prescribed. Each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal. Unless otherwise specified in the certificate of incorporation, elections of directors need not be by written ballot. 3.4.Resignation And Vacancies Any director may resign at any time upon written notice to the attention of the Secretary of the corporation. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 223(a)(1) and 223(a)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, any vacancy or newly created directorship may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office (including any directors that have tendered a resignation effective at a future date), though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and the directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election and until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced; provided, however, that where such vacancy or newly created directorship occurs among the directors elected by the holders of a class or series of stock, the holders of shares of such class or series may override the Board of Directors' action to fill such vacancy or newly created directorship by (i) voting for their own designee to fill such vacancy or newly created directorship at a meeting of the corporation's stockholders or (ii) written consent, if the consenting stockholders hold a sufficient number of shares to elect their designee at a meeting of the stockholders. If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least 10% of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the Delaware General Corporation Law as far as applicable. 3.5.Place Of Meetings; Meetings By Telephone The Board of Directors of the corporation may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or outside the state of Delaware. Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors, or any committee, by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. 3.6.Regular Meetings Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without notice at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be determined by the board. 3.7.Special Meetings; Notice Special meetings of the Board of Directors for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the chairperson of the board, the chief executive officer, the president, the secretary or any two directors. Notice of the time and place of special meetings shall be delivered personally or by telephone to each director or sent by first-class mail, facsimile, electronic transmission, or telegram, charges prepaid, addressed to each director at that director's address as it is shown on the records of the corporation. If the notice is mailed, it shall be deposited in the United States mail at least 4 days before the time of the holding of the meeting. If the notice is delivered personally or by facsimile, electronic transmission, telephone or telegram, it shall be delivered at least 24 hours before the time of the holding of the meeting. Any oral notice given personally or by telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a person at the office of the director who the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director. The notice need not specify the purpose of the meeting. The notice need not specify the place of the meeting, if the meeting is to be held at the principal executive office of the corporation. Unless otherwise indicated in the notice thereof, any and all business may be transacted at a special meeting. 3.8.Quorum At all meetings of the Board of Directors, a majority of the total number of duly elected directors then in office (but in no case less than 1/3 of the total number of authorized directors) shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the Board of Directors, then the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present. A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for that meeting. 3.9.Waiver Of Notice Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, or waiver by electronic mail or other electronic transmission by such person, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the directors, or members of a committee of directors, need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws. 3.10.Board Action By Written Consent Without A Meeting Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing or writings or electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the board or committee. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in electronic form. Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any and all purposes for which the original writing could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing. 3.11.Fees And Compensation Of Directors Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, the Board of Directors shall have the authority to fix the compensation of directors. No such compensation shall preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. 3.12.Approval Of Loans To Officers The corporation may lend money to, or guarantee any obligation of, or otherwise assist any officer or other employee of the corporation or of its subsidiary, including any officer or employee who is a director of the corporation or its subsidiary, whenever, in the judgment of the directors, such loan, guaranty or assistance may reasonably be expected to benefit the corporation. The loan, guaranty or other assistance may be with or without interest and may be unsecured, or secured in such manner as the Board of Directors shall approve, including, without limitation, a pledge of shares of stock of the corporation. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to deny, limit or restrict the powers of guaranty or warranty of the corporation at common law or under any statute. 3.13.Removal Of Directors Unless otherwise restricted by statute, by the certificate of incorporation or by these bylaws, any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed, with or without cause, by, and only by, the affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of the class or series of stock entitled to elect such director or directors, given either at a special meeting of such stockholders duly called for that purpose or pursuant to a written consent of stockholders, and any vacancy thereby created may be filled by the holders of that class or series of stock represented at the meeting or pursuant to written consent; provided, however, that if the stockholders of the corporation are entitled to cumulative voting, if less than the entire Board of Directors is to be removed, no director may be removed without cause if the votes cast against his removal would be sufficient to elect him if then cumulatively voted at an election of the entire Board of Directors. No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director prior to the expiration of such director's term of office. 3.14.Chairperson Of The Board Of Directors The corporation may also have, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, a chairperson of the Board of Directors who shall not be considered an officer of the corporation. ARTICLE IV COMMITTEES 4.1.Committees Of Directors The Board of Directors may designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the corporation. The Board may designate 1 or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors, or in these bylaws, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority in reference to the following matters: (i) approving or adopting, or recommending to the stockholders, any action or matter expressly required by the General Corporate Law of Delaware to be submitted to stockholders for approval or (ii) adopting, amending or repealing any Bylaw of the corporation. 4.2.Committee Minutes Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report the same to the Board of Directors when required. 4.3.Meetings And Action Of Committees Meetings and actions of committees shall be governed by, and held and taken in accordance with, the provisions of Section 3.5 (place of meetings and meetings by telephone), Section 3.6 (regular meetings), Section 3.7 (special meetings and notice), Section 3.8 (quorum), Section 3.9 (waiver of notice), and Section 3.10 (action without a meeting) of these bylaws, with such changes in the context of such provisions as are necessary to substitute the committee and its members for the Board of Directors and its members; provided, however, that the time of regular meetings of committees may be determined either by resolution of the Board of Directors or by resolution of the committee, that special meetings of committees may also be called by resolution of the Board of Directors and that notice of special meetings of committees shall also be given to all alternate members, who shall have the right to attend all meetings of the committee. The Board of Directors may adopt rules for the government of any committee not inconsistent with the provisions of these bylaws.

Any officer may resign at any time by giving written notice to the corporation. Any resignation shall take effect at the date of the receipt of that notice or at any later time specified in that notice; and, unless otherwise specified in that notice, the acceptance of the resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.

ARTICLE VI INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND OTHER AGENTS 6.1.Indemnification Of Directors And Officers The corporation shall, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, indemnify each of its directors and officers against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding, arising by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of the corporation. For purposes of this Section 6.1, a \"director\" or \"officer\" of the corporation includes any person (a) who is or was a director or officer of the corporation, (b) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (c) who was a director or officer of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation. 6.2.Indemnification Of Others The corporation shall have the power, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, to indemnify each of its employees and agents (other than directors and officers) against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding, arising by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of the corporation. For purposes of this Section 6.2, an \"employee\" or \"agent\" of the corporation (other than a director or officer) includes any person (a) who is or was an employee or agent of the corporation, (b) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (c) who was an employee or agent of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation. 6.3.Payment Of Expenses In Advance Expenses incurred in defending any action or proceeding for which indemnification is required pursuant to Section 6.1 or for which indemnification is permitted pursuant to Section 6.2 following authorization thereof by the Board of Directors shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the indemnified party to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that the indemnified party is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this Article VI. 6.4.Indemnity Not Exclusive The indemnification provided by this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any Bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, to the extent that such additional rights to indemnification are authorized in the certificate of incorporation. 6.5.Insurance The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law. 6.6.Conflicts No indemnification or advance shall be made under this Article VI, except where such indemnification or advance is mandated by law or the order, judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, in any circumstance where it appears: (a) That it would be inconsistent with a provision of the certificate of incorporation, these bylaws, a resolution of the stockholders or an agreement in effect at the time of the accrual of the alleged cause of the action asserted in the proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or other amounts were paid, which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification; or (b) That it would be inconsistent with any condition expressly imposed by a court in approving a settlement. ARTICLE VII RECORDS AND REPORTS 7.1.Maintenance And Inspection Of Records The corporation shall, either at its principal executive offices or at such place or places as designated by the Board of Directors, keep a record of its stockholders listing their names and addresses and the number and class of shares held by each stockholder, a copy of these bylaws as amended to date, accounting books, and other records. Any stockholder of record, in person or by attorney or other agent, shall, upon written demand under oath stating the purpose thereof, have the right during the usual hours for business to inspect for any proper purpose the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and records and to make copies or extracts therefrom. A proper purpose shall mean a purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as a stockholder. In every instance where an attorney or other agent is the person who seeks the right to inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of attorney or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act on behalf of the stockholder. The demand under oath shall be directed to the corporation at its registered office in Delaware or at its principal place of business. A complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders, arranged in alphabetical order for each class of stock and showing the address of each such stockholder and the number of shares registered in each such stockholder's name, shall be open to the examination of any such stockholder for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting in the manner provided by law. The stock list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting as provided by law. This list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them. 7.2.Inspection By Directors Any director shall have the right to examine the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and records for a purpose reasonably related to his or her position as a director. The Court of Chancery is hereby vested with the exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a director is entitled to the inspection sought. The Court may summarily order the corporation to permit the director to inspect any and all books and records, the stock ledger, and the stock list and to make copies or extracts therefrom. The Court may, in its discretion, prescribe any limitations or conditions with reference to the inspection, or award such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. ARTICLE VIII GENERAL MATTERS 8.1.Checks From time to time, the Board of Directors shall determine by resolution which person or persons may sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness that are issued in the name of or payable to the corporation, and only the persons so authorized shall sign or endorse those instruments. 8.2.Execution Of Corporate Contracts And Instruments The Board of Directors, except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, may authorize any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the corporation; such authority may be general or confined to specific instances. Unless so authorized or ratified by the Board of Directors or within the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount. 8.3.Stock Certificates and Notices; Uncertificated Stock; Partly Paid Shares The shares of the corporation may be certificated or uncertificated, as provided under Delaware law, and shall be entered in the books of the corporation and recorded as they are issued. Any or all of the signatures on any certificate may be a facsimile or electronic signature. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile or electronic signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated stock and upon the request of a stockholder, the corporation shall send to the record owner thereof a written notice that shall set forth the name of the corporation, that the corporation is organized under the laws of Delaware, the name of the stockholder, the number and class (and the designation of the series, if any) of the shares, and any restrictions on the transfer or registration of such shares of stock imposed by the corporation's certificate of incorporation, these bylaws, any agreement among stockholders or any agreement between stockholders and the corporation. The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate (if any) issued to represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon. 8.4.Special Designation On Certificates and Notices of Issuance If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock or the notice of issuance to the record owner of uncertificated stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock or the notice of issuance to the record owner of uncertificated stock, or the purchase agreement for such stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights. 8.5.Lost Certificates Except as provided in this Section 8.5, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and cancelled at the same time. The corporation may issue a new certificate of stock or notice of uncertificated stock in the place of any certificate previously issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or the owner's legal representative, to give the corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares. 8.6.Construction; Definitions Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of construction, and definitions in the Delaware General Corporation Law shall govern the construction of these bylaws. Without limiting the generality of this provision, the singular number includes the plural, the plural number includes the singular, and the term \"person\" includes both a corporation and a natural person. 8.7.Dividends The directors of the corporation, subject to any restrictions contained in (a) the Delaware General Corporation Law or (b) the certificate of incorporation, may declare and pay dividends upon the shares of its capital stock. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the corporation's capital stock. The directors of the corporation may set apart out of any of the funds of the corporation available for dividends a reserve or reserves for any proper purpose and may abolish any such reserve. Such purposes shall include but not be limited to equalizing dividends, repairing or maintaining any property of the corporation, and meeting contingencies. 8.8.Fiscal Year The fiscal year of the corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors and may be changed by the Board of Directors. 8.9.Transfer Restrictions Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, except as expressly permitted in this Section 8.9, a stockholder shall not Transfer (as such term is defined below) any shares of the corporation's stock (or any rights of or interests in such shares) to any person unless such Transfer is approved by the Board of Directors prior to such Transfer, which approval may be granted or withheld in the Board of Directors' sole and absolute discretion. \"Transfer\" shall mean, with respect to any security, the direct or indirect assignment, sale, transfer, tender, pledge, hypothecation, or the grant, creation or suffrage of a lien or encumbrance in or upon, or the gift, placement in trust, or the Constructive Sale (as such term is defined below) or other disposition of such security (including transfer by testamentary or intestate succession, merger or otherwise by operation of law) or any right, title or interest therein (including, but not limited to, any right or power to vote to which the holder thereof may be entitled, whether such right or power is granted by proxy or otherwise), or the record or beneficial ownership thereof, the offer to make such a sale, transfer, Constructive Sale or other disposition, and each agreement, arrangement or understanding, whether or not in writing, to effect any of the foregoing. \"Constructive Sale\" shall mean, with respect to any security, a short sale with respect to such security, entering into or acquiring an offsetting derivative contract with respect to such security, entering into or acquiring a futures or forward contract to deliver such security, or entering into any other hedging or other derivative transaction that has the effect of materially changing the economic benefits and risks of ownership. Any purported Transfer of any shares of the corporation's stock effected in violation of this Section 8.9 shall be null and void and shall have no force or effect and the corporation shall not register any such purported Transfer. Any stockholder seeking the approval of the Board of Directors of a Transfer of some or all of its shares shall give written notice thereof to the Secretary of the corporation that shall include: (a) the name of the stockholder; (b) the proposed transferee; (c) the number of shares of the Transfer of which approval is thereby requested; and (d) the purchase price (if any) of the shares proposed for Transfer. The corporation may require the stockholder to supplement its notice with such additional information as the corporation may request. Certificates representing, and in the case of uncertificated securities, notices of issuance with respect to, shares of stock of the corporation shall have impressed on, printed on, written on or otherwise affixed to them the following legend: THE TRANSFER OF THE SECURITIES REFERENCED HEREIN IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN THE COMPANY'S BYLAWS, COPIES OF WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED UPON WRITTEN REQUEST TO THE COMPANY AT ITS PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS. THE COMPANY SHALL NOT REGISTER OR OTHERWISE RECOGNIZE OR GIVE EFFECT TO ANY PURPORTED TRANSFER OF SECURITIES THAT DOES NOT COMPLY WITH SUCH TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS. The corporation shall take all such actions as are practicable to cause the certificates representing, and notices of issuance with respect to, shares that are subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth in this Section to contain the foregoing legend. 8.10.Transfer Of Stock Upon receipt by the corporation or the transfer agent of the corporation of proper transfer instructions from the record holder of uncertificated shares or upon surrender to the corporation or the transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignation or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate or, in the case of uncertificated securities and upon request, a notice of issuance of shares, to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate (if any) and record the transaction in its books. 8.11.Stock Transfer Agreements The corporation shall have power to enter into and perform any agreement with any number of stockholders of any one or more classes of stock of the corporation to restrict the transfer of shares of stock of the corporation of any one or more classes owned by such stockholders in any manner not prohibited by the Delaware General Corporation Law. 8.12.Stockholders of Record The corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person recorded on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends and to vote as such owner, shall be entitled to hold liable for calls and assessments the person recorded on its books as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of another person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware. 8.13.Facsimile or Electronic Signature In addition to the provisions for use of facsimile or electronic signatures elsewhere specifically authorized in these bylaws, facsimile or electronic signatures of any stockholder, director or officer of the corporation may be used whenever and as authorized by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof. ARTICLE IX AMENDMENTS The Bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the corporation may, in its certificate of incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws upon the directors. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws.","title":"CORPORATE BYLAWS FREIGHTTRUST AND CLEARING, INC."},{"location":"corporate/bylaws/#corporate-bylaws-freighttrust-and-clearing-inc","text":"@version 2020.01.20 @author FreightTrust & Clearing Corporation","title":"CORPORATE BYLAWS FREIGHTTRUST AND CLEARING, INC."},{"location":"corporate/bylaws/#article-i","text":"","title":"ARTICLE I"},{"location":"corporate/bylaws/#corporate-offices","text":"1.1.Offices In addition to the corporation's registered office set forth in the certificate of incorporation, the Board of Directors may at any time establish other offices at any place or places where the corporation is qualified to do business.","title":"CORPORATE OFFICES"},{"location":"corporate/bylaws/#article-ii","text":"","title":"ARTICLE II"},{"location":"corporate/bylaws/#meetings-of-stockholders","text":"2.1.Place Of Meetings Meetings of stockholders shall be held at any place, within or outside the state of Delaware, designated by the Board of Directors.

At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the place (if any), date and time of the adjourned meeting and the means of remote communications (if any) by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. 2.8.Organization; Conduct of Business Such person as the Board of Directors may have designated or, in the absence of such a person, the chief executive officer, or in his or her absence, the president or, in his or her absence, such person as may be chosen by the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, shall call to order any meeting of the stockholders and act as chairperson of the meeting. In the absence of the secretary of the corporation, the secretary of the meeting shall be such person as the chairperson of the meeting appoints. The chairperson of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including the manner of voting and the conduct of business. The date and time of opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at the meeting shall be announced at the meeting. 2.9.Voting The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.12 of these bylaws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock and to voting trusts and other voting agreements).

Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice, or any waiver of notice by electronic transmission, unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws. 2.11.Stockholder Action By Written Consent Without A Meeting Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation, or any action that may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is (a) signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted, and (b) delivered to the corporation in accordance with Section 228(a) of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

A telegram, cablegram, electronic mail or other electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a stockholder or proxyholder, or by a person or persons authorized to act for a stockholder or proxyholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and dated for purposes of this Section to the extent permitted by law. Any such consent shall be delivered in accordance with Section 228(d)(1) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any and all purposes for which the original writing could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing (including by electronic mail or other electronic transmission as permitted by law). If the action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any section of the Delaware General Corporation Law if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, then the certificate filed under such section shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such section concerning any vote of stockholders, that written notice and written consent have been given as provided in Section 228 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. 2.12.Record Date For Stockholder Notice; Voting; Giving Consents In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting, nor more than 60 days prior to any other action. If the Board of Directors does not so fix a record date: a. The record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. b. The record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is necessary, shall be the day on which the first written consent (including consent by electronic mail or other electronic transmission as permitted by law) is delivered to the corporation. c. The record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting, if such adjournment is for 30 days or less; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. 2.13.Proxies Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by an instrument in writing or by an electronic transmission permitted by law filed with the secretary of the corporation, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, facsimile, electronic or telegraphic transmission or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(e) of the Delaware General Corporation Law.","title":"MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS"},{"location":"corporate/bylaws/#article-iii","text":"","title":"ARTICLE III"},{"location":"corporate/bylaws/#directors","text":"3.1.Powers Subject to the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and any limitations in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws relating to action required to be approved by the stockholders or by the outstanding shares, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the Board of Directors. 3.2.Number Of Directors The number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors is one (1). This number may be changed by a resolution of the Board of Directors or of the stockholders, subject to Section 3.4 of these bylaws. No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director before such director's term of office expires. 3.3.Election, Qualification And Term Of Office Of Directors Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws, and unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders to hold office until the next annual meeting.

If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least 10% of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the Delaware General Corporation Law as far as applicable. 3.5.Place Of Meetings; Meetings By Telephone The Board of Directors of the corporation may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or outside the state of Delaware.

Notice of the time and place of special meetings shall be delivered personally or by telephone to each director or sent by first-class mail, facsimile, electronic transmission, or telegram, charges prepaid, addressed to each director at that director's address as it is shown on the records of the corporation. If the notice is mailed, it shall be deposited in the United States mail at least 4 days before the time of the holding of the meeting. If the notice is delivered personally or by facsimile, electronic transmission, telephone or telegram, it shall be delivered at least 24 hours before the time of the holding of the meeting. Any oral notice given personally or by telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a person at the office of the director who the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director. The notice need not specify the purpose of the meeting. The notice need not specify the place of the meeting, if the meeting is to be held at the principal executive office of the corporation. Unless otherwise indicated in the notice thereof, any and all business may be transacted at a special meeting. 3.8.Quorum At all meetings of the Board of Directors, a majority of the total number of duly elected directors then in office (but in no case less than 1/3 of the total number of authorized directors) shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the Board of Directors, then the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present. A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for that meeting. 3.9.Waiver Of Notice Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, or waiver by electronic mail or other electronic transmission by such person, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the directors, or members of a committee of directors, need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws. 3.10.Board Action By Written Consent Without A Meeting Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing or writings or electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the board or committee. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in electronic form. Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any and all purposes for which the original writing could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing. 3.11.Fees And Compensation Of Directors Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, the Board of Directors shall have the authority to fix the compensation of directors. No such compensation shall preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. 3.12.Approval Of Loans To Officers The corporation may lend money to, or guarantee any obligation of, or otherwise assist any officer or other employee of the corporation or of its subsidiary, including any officer or employee who is a director of the corporation or its subsidiary, whenever, in the judgment of the directors, such loan, guaranty or assistance may reasonably be expected to benefit the corporation. The loan, guaranty or other assistance may be with or without interest and may be unsecured, or secured in such manner as the Board of Directors shall approve, including, without limitation, a pledge of shares of stock of the corporation. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to deny, limit or restrict the powers of guaranty or warranty of the corporation at common law or under any statute. 3.13.Removal Of Directors Unless otherwise restricted by statute, by the certificate of incorporation or by these bylaws, any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed, with or without cause, by, and only by, the affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of the class or series of stock entitled to elect such director or directors, given either at a special meeting of such stockholders duly called for that purpose or pursuant to a written consent of stockholders, and any vacancy thereby created may be filled by the holders of that class or series of stock represented at the meeting or pursuant to written consent; provided, however, that if the stockholders of the corporation are entitled to cumulative voting, if less than the entire Board of Directors is to be removed, no director may be removed without cause if the votes cast against his removal would be sufficient to elect him if then cumulatively voted at an election of the entire Board of Directors. No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director prior to the expiration of such director's term of office. 3.14.Chairperson Of The Board Of Directors The corporation may also have, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, a chairperson of the Board of Directors who shall not be considered an officer of the corporation.","title":"DIRECTORS"},{"location":"corporate/bylaws/#article-iv","text":"","title":"ARTICLE IV"},{"location":"corporate/bylaws/#committees","text":"4.1.Committees Of Directors The Board of Directors may designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the corporation.

All Rights Reserved","title":"<br>"},{"location":"corporate/code-of-conduct/","text":"Freight Trust Code of Conduct Freight Trust Network is a collaborative project from Freight Trust & Clearing Corporation. It is an open-source and open community project where participants choose to work together, and in that process experience differences in language, location, nationality, and experience. In such a diverse environment, misunderstandings and disagreements happen, which in most cases can be resolved informally. In rare cases, however, behavior can intimidate, harass, or otherwise disrupt one or more people in the community, which Freight Trust Network and Freight Trust & Clearing will not tolerate. A Code of Conduct is useful to define accepted and acceptable behaviors and to promote high standards of professional practice. It also provides a benchmark for self evaluation and acts as a vehicle for better identity of the organization. This code (CoC) applies to any member of the Freight Trust community \u2013 developers, participants in meetings, teleconferences, mailing lists, conferences or functions, etc. Note that this code complements rather than replaces legal rights and obligations pertaining to any particular situation. Statement of Intent Freight Trust is committed to maintain a positive work environment. This commitment calls for a workplace where participants at all levels behave according to the rules of the following code. A foundational concept of this code is that we all share responsibility for our work environment. Code Treat each other with respect, professionalism, fairness, and sensitivity to our many differences and strengths, including in situations of high pressure and urgency. Never harass or bully anyone verbally, physically or sexually. Never discriminate on the basis of personal characteristics or group membership. Communicate constructively and avoid demeaning or insulting behavior or language. Seek, accept, and offer objective work criticism, and acknowledge properly the contributions of others. Be honest about your own qualifications, and about any circumstances that might lead to conflicts of interest. Respect the privacy of others and the confidentiality of data you access. With respect to cultural differences, be conservative in what you do and conservative in what you accept from others, but not to the point of accepting disrespectful, unprofessional or unfair or unwelcome behavior or advances. Promote the rules of this Code and take action (especially if you are in a leadership position) to bring the discussion back to a more civil level whenever inappropriate behaviors are observed. Stay on topic: Make sure that you are posting to the correct channel and avoid off-topic discussions. Remember when you update an issue or respond to an email you are potentially sending to a large number of people. Step down considerately: Members of every project come and go, and the Freight Trust is no different. When you leave or disengage from the project, in whole or in part, we ask that you do so in a way that minimizes disruption to the project. This means you should tell people you are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where you left off. Glossary Demeaning Behavior is acting in a way that reduces another person\u2019s dignity, sense of self-worth or respect within the community. Discrimination is the prejudicial treatment of an individual based on criteria such as: physical appearance, race, ethnic origin, genetic differences, national or social origin, name, religion, gender, sexual orientation, family or health situation, pregnancy, disability, age, education, wealth, domicile, political view, morals, employment, or union activity. Insulting Behavior is treating another person with scorn or disrespect. Acknowledgement is a record of the origin(s) and author(s) of a contribution. Harassment is any conduct, verbal or physical, that has the intent or effect of interfering with an individual, or that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment. Leadership Position includes group Chairs, project maintainers, staff members, node operators, network operators, and Board members. Participant includes the following persons: Developers Node Operators Network Operators Member representatives Staff members Anyone from the Public partaking in the Freight Trust work environment (e.g. contribute code, comment on our code or specs, email us, attend our conferences, functions, etc) Respect is the genuine consideration you have for someone (if only because of their status as participant in Freight Trust, like yourself), and that you show by treating them in a polite and kind way. Sexual Harassment includes visual displays of degrading sexual images, sexually suggestive conduct, offensive remarks of a sexual nature, requests for sexual favors, unwelcome physical contact, and sexual assault. Unwelcome Behavior Hard to define? Some questions to ask yourself are: how would I feel if I were in the position of the recipient? would my spouse, parent, child, sibling or friend like to be treated this way? would I like an account of my behavior published in the organization\u2019s newsletter? could my behavior offend or hurt other members of the work group? could someone misinterpret my behavior as intentionally harmful or harassing? would I treat my boss or a person I admire at work like that ? Summary: if you are unsure whether something might be welcome or unwelcome, don\u2019t do it.

It is an open-source and open community project where participants choose to work together, and in that process experience differences in language, location, nationality, and experience. In such a diverse environment, misunderstandings and disagreements happen, which in most cases can be resolved informally. In rare cases, however, behavior can intimidate, harass, or otherwise disrupt one or more people in the community, which Freight Trust Network and Freight Trust & Clearing will not tolerate. A Code of Conduct is useful to define accepted and acceptable behaviors and to promote high standards of professional practice. It also provides a benchmark for self evaluation and acts as a vehicle for better identity of the organization. This code (CoC) applies to any member of the Freight Trust community \u2013 developers, participants in meetings, teleconferences, mailing lists, conferences or functions, etc. Note that this code complements rather than replaces legal rights and obligations pertaining to any particular situation. Statement of Intent Freight Trust is committed to maintain a positive work environment. This commitment calls for a workplace where participants at all levels behave according to the rules of the following code. A foundational concept of this code is that we all share responsibility for our work environment.","title":"Freight Trust Code of Conduct"},{"location":"corporate/code-of-conduct/#code","text":"Treat each other with respect, professionalism, fairness, and sensitivity to our many differences and strengths, including in situations of high pressure and urgency. Never harass or bully anyone verbally, physically or sexually. Never discriminate on the basis of personal characteristics or group membership. Communicate constructively and avoid demeaning or insulting behavior or language. Seek, accept, and offer objective work criticism, and acknowledge properly the contributions of others. Be honest about your own qualifications, and about any circumstances that might lead to conflicts of interest. Respect the privacy of others and the confidentiality of data you access. With respect to cultural differences, be conservative in what you do and conservative in what you accept from others, but not to the point of accepting disrespectful, unprofessional or unfair or unwelcome behavior or advances. Promote the rules of this Code and take action (especially if you are in a leadership position) to bring the discussion back to a more civil level whenever inappropriate behaviors are observed. Stay on topic: Make sure that you are posting to the correct channel and avoid off-topic discussions. Remember when you update an issue or respond to an email you are potentially sending to a large number of people. Step down considerately: Members of every project come and go, and the Freight Trust is no different. When you leave or disengage from the project, in whole or in part, we ask that you do so in a way that minimizes disruption to the project. This means you should tell people you are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where you left off.","title":"Code"},{"location":"corporate/code-of-conduct/#glossary","text":"Demeaning Behavior is acting in a way that reduces another person\u2019s dignity, sense of self-worth or respect within the community.","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"corporate/code-of-conduct/#discrimination","text":"is the prejudicial treatment of an individual based on criteria such as: physical appearance, race, ethnic origin, genetic differences, national or social origin, name, religion, gender, sexual orientation, family or health situation, pregnancy, disability, age, education, wealth, domicile, political view, morals, employment, or union activity. Insulting Behavior is treating another person with scorn or disrespect. Acknowledgement is a record of the origin(s) and author(s) of a contribution. Harassment is any conduct, verbal or physical, that has the intent or effect of interfering with an individual, or that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment.

Participant includes the following persons: Developers Node Operators Network Operators Member representatives Staff members Anyone from the Public partaking in the Freight Trust work environment (e.g. contribute code, comment on our code or specs, email us, attend our conferences, functions, etc) Respect is the genuine consideration you have for someone (if only because of their status as participant in Freight Trust, like yourself), and that you show by treating them in a polite and kind way. Sexual Harassment includes visual displays of degrading sexual images, sexually suggestive conduct, offensive remarks of a sexual nature, requests for sexual favors, unwelcome physical contact, and sexual assault. Unwelcome Behavior Hard to define? Some questions to ask yourself are: how would I feel if I were in the position of the recipient? would my spouse, parent, child, sibling or friend like to be treated this way? would I like an account of my behavior published in the organization\u2019s newsletter? could my behavior offend or hurt other members of the work group? could someone misinterpret my behavior as intentionally harmful or harassing? would I treat my boss or a person I admire at work like that ?

Customer shall deduct from any invoice to Carrier the reasonable salvage value of any damaged Goods that have been returned to Customer; provided, however, that Customer shall not be obligated to make any such deduction for, or to surrender to Carrier, any Shipment or portion thereof which Customer has destroyed or agrees to destroy because[, pursuant to the provisions of any applicable Law or any written or unwritten trade or industry standard or practice/in Customer\u2019s [sole/reasonable] judgment], the Goods have been rendered unfit or unsuitable for sale, use, or consumption due to spoilage, contamination, or adulteration in transit or a reasonable suspicion thereof. 5.3 Claim Procedure Claim Procedure.

Insurance. 6.1 Requirement to Obtain Insurance. Carrier shall procure and keep in force continuously [during the Term] the following types of insurance: (a) Commercial general liability insurance, including blanket contractual coverage, for bodily injury and property damage in the amount of US$[AMOUNT] combined single limit per occurrence. > SEE NOTE [6] Appendix TRANSPORTATION SERVICES This Standard Document sets out a basic definition of the services to be provided by the carrier. The parties must revise this definition (or use a different form of agreement) if the carrier will provide additional or specialized services, for example: - Temporary warehouse services. - Rail transportation. - Air transportation. - Waterway transportation. - Pipeline transportation. - Refrigerated transportation. - Expedited service. [2] PROVISION OF TRANSPORT SERVIES This Document acknowledges that carriers employ a variety of order and acceptance procedures, which may include: Manually implemented systems utilizing the customer\u2019s shipment request and carrier\u2019s acceptances. Either the carrier\u2019s or customer\u2019s electronic data platform. When the carrier agrees to provide the transportation services at its cost and expense, it is agreeing to assume all costs and expenses incident to the transportation of shipments. This includes all costs of fuel and insurance, as well as incident to or arising out of the maintenance, repair or operation of its trucks and other equipment. If there are any out-of-pocket or other costs that are not covered as overhead by the purchase price of the transportation services, and which the carrier would like to pass along to the customer (for example, any fuel surcharge), it must be sure to clarify the allocation in Section 8. SUBCONTRACTING: The parties must negotiate: Whether to allow the carrier to subcontract some or all of the transportation services. If the parties allow the carrier to subcontract: how much discretion the carrier has in its choice of subcontractor; and the conditions that must be satisfied. [3] Carrier\u2019s Right to Reject Shipment Requests This pro-customer Standard Document does not give the carrier the right to reject shipment requests. The customer can expect the carrier to negotiate the right to accept or reject shipment requests. If the customer agrees to give the carrier the right to reject shipment requests, it should negotiate to restrict the carrier\u2019s discretion based on objective criteria, for example: The customer\u2019s credit status. The size of the request. Whether the carrier has the capacity. In addition, the customer may want to require the carrier to: Accept the shipment request within a certain period of time. Notify the customer in writing of any rejection or cancellation within a certain period of time. [5] CARRIER BEARS RISK OF LOSS In this provision, the carrier undertakes to bear the entire risk of loss, damage or injury to the goods. Since the carrier bears the risk of loss, it must compensate the customer for any loss either: Directly. Through the proceeds of any cargo insurance maintained by the carrier under Section 6.1(b). The bracketed language anticipates that the carrier will attempt to limit its liability by excluding loss, damage or injury resulting from acts beyond its control. The parties can define the acts beyond the carrier\u2019s control either by: Referencing to the definition of Force Majeure Event. Listing the acts specifically. [6] Insurance coverage enables: The carrier to mitigate its financial exposure to the specified risk by shifting the risk to its insurer, in exchange for an insurance premium that usually represents a fraction of the total coverage the policy provides. The customer to limit its risk that the carrier does not have the financial capacity to cover its liabilities under the contract. This Standard Document assumes that the carrier is a contract carrier, which is not required to maintain all types of insurance. However, this Standard Document aims to be reasonable by imposing the contractual requirement that the carrier procure and maintain at least: * Liability insurance (see Section 6.1(a)). * Property insurance (see Section 6.1(b).) Deductibles. A policy that has a deductible reduces the total amount of coverage provided by the policy by the amount of the deductible. For example, an insurance policy providing $200,000 in coverage with a $10,000 deductible would cover $190,000 worth of any loss suffered by the policyholder in excess of the $10,000 deductible. SIRs. A SIR does not reduce policy limits, but must be satisfied before the policy limits can be tapped.

The parties must revise this definition (or use a different form of agreement) if the carrier will provide additional or specialized services, for example: - Temporary warehouse services. - Rail transportation. - Air transportation. - Waterway transportation. - Pipeline transportation. - Refrigerated transportation. - Expedited service. [2] PROVISION OF TRANSPORT SERVIES This Document acknowledges that carriers employ a variety of order and acceptance procedures, which may include: Manually implemented systems utilizing the customer\u2019s shipment request and carrier\u2019s acceptances. Either the carrier\u2019s or customer\u2019s electronic data platform. When the carrier agrees to provide the transportation services at its cost and expense, it is agreeing to assume all costs and expenses incident to the transportation of shipments. This includes all costs of fuel and insurance, as well as incident to or arising out of the maintenance, repair or operation of its trucks and other equipment. If there are any out-of-pocket or other costs that are not covered as overhead by the purchase price of the transportation services, and which the carrier would like to pass along to the customer (for example, any fuel surcharge), it must be sure to clarify the allocation in Section 8. SUBCONTRACTING: The parties must negotiate: Whether to allow the carrier to subcontract some or all of the transportation services. If the parties allow the carrier to subcontract: how much discretion the carrier has in its choice of subcontractor; and the conditions that must be satisfied. [3] Carrier\u2019s Right to Reject Shipment Requests This pro-customer Standard Document does not give the carrier the right to reject shipment requests. The customer can expect the carrier to negotiate the right to accept or reject shipment requests. If the customer agrees to give the carrier the right to reject shipment requests, it should negotiate to restrict the carrier\u2019s discretion based on objective criteria, for example: The customer\u2019s credit status. The size of the request. Whether the carrier has the capacity. In addition, the customer may want to require the carrier to: Accept the shipment request within a certain period of time. Notify the customer in writing of any rejection or cancellation within a certain period of time. [5] CARRIER BEARS RISK OF LOSS In this provision, the carrier undertakes to bear the entire risk of loss, damage or injury to the goods. Since the carrier bears the risk of loss, it must compensate the customer for any loss either: Directly. Through the proceeds of any cargo insurance maintained by the carrier under Section 6.1(b). The bracketed language anticipates that the carrier will attempt to limit its liability by excluding loss, damage or injury resulting from acts beyond its control. The parties can define the acts beyond the carrier\u2019s control either by: Referencing to the definition of Force Majeure Event. Listing the acts specifically. [6] Insurance coverage enables: The carrier to mitigate its financial exposure to the specified risk by shifting the risk to its insurer, in exchange for an insurance premium that usually represents a fraction of the total coverage the policy provides. The customer to limit its risk that the carrier does not have the financial capacity to cover its liabilities under the contract. This Standard Document assumes that the carrier is a contract carrier, which is not required to maintain all types of insurance. However, this Standard Document aims to be reasonable by imposing the contractual requirement that the carrier procure and maintain at least: * Liability insurance (see Section 6.1(a)). * Property insurance (see Section 6.1(b).) Deductibles. A policy that has a deductible reduces the total amount of coverage provided by the policy by the amount of the deductible. For example, an insurance policy providing $200,000 in coverage with a $10,000 deductible would cover $190,000 worth of any loss suffered by the policyholder in excess of the $10,000 deductible. SIRs. A SIR does not reduce policy limits, but must be satisfied before the policy limits can be tapped. A policy that has a SIR requires the policyholder to incur a loss in excess of the SIR amount before coverage is triggered, but will then cover up to the full amount of coverage. For example, a $200,000 insurance policy with a $10,000 SIR would provide a full $200,000 worth of coverage after the policyholder had paid $10,000 to satisfy the SIR.","title":"TRANSPORTATION SERVICES"},{"location":"rulebook/0-governing-laws/","text":"Governing Laws Governing Law for Bills of Lading Depending on where the goods are transported, a bill of lading is governed by either or both: The Federal Bills of Lading Act (Federal Act) (49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 80101 - 80116) (see Federal Bills of Lading Act). Article 7 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) (UCC \u00a7\u00a7 7-101 - 7-603) (see UCC Article 7). The Federal Act and Article 7 are generally consistent with each other. However, in transactions where both laws are applicable and there is a conflict, the Federal Act governs. Federal Bills of Lading Act The Federal Act governs bills of lading that are used in interstate or foreign commerce. Specifically, the Federal Act applies to all bills of lading that a common carrier issues for goods transported: (a). Between a location in: (i) Washington DC and another location in Washington DC; (ii) a US territory or possession and another location in the same territory or possession; (iii) a US state and a location in another US state; or (iv) a US state and a location in the same state through another US state or a foreign country. From a place in a US state to a location in a foreign country. (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 80102.) Although the Federal Act governs bills of lading that are issued in the US for goods traveling to foreign countries, it does not govern bills of lading that are issued in foreign countries, even if the goods are destined for the US. UCC Article 7 Article 7 of the UCC governs bills of lading when the transaction or shipment relates to intrastate commerce. Article 7 of the UCC supplements, but is generally consistent with, the Federal Act. How Bills of Lading Are Used A bill of lading is an agreement between a consignor of goods and the carrier transporting the goods. The bill of lading serves as both: A receipt that provides the consignor with evidence of the goods\u2019 delivery to the carrier. A contract that states the terms and conditions under which the carrier agrees to transport the goods. The parties generally engaged in a transaction involving a bill of lading are: The shipper or consignor. The shipper or consignor is the party sending the goods. The carrier or bailee. The carrier (or bailee under the UCC) has possession of the goods and contracts to deliver them. The consignee. The consignee is the party to whom the goods are delivered. The carrier or its agent signs the bill of lading and issues it to the consignor. The consignor then typically sends the consignee or its agent the bill of lading through mail or another means of communication. Any kind of carrier can issue a bill of lading, regardless of the transportation method (whether by land, water, or air). The carrier issues the bill of lading to the consignor at either: The place of shipment [x]. The destination point [y]. Any other designated place that the consignor requests. The carrier then delivers the goods covered in the bill of lading to either: The order of a consignor or consignee, if the bill of lading is negotiable (for an explanation of negotiable bills of lading, see Order Bill of Lading). A specifically named consignee, if the bill of lading is nonnegotiable (for an explanation of nonnegotiable bills of lading, see Straight Bill of Lading).

A contract that states the terms and conditions under which the carrier agrees to transport the goods. The parties generally engaged in a transaction involving a bill of lading are: The shipper or consignor. The shipper or consignor is the party sending the goods. The carrier or bailee. The carrier (or bailee under the UCC) has possession of the goods and contracts to deliver them. The consignee. The consignee is the party to whom the goods are delivered. The carrier or its agent signs the bill of lading and issues it to the consignor. The consignor then typically sends the consignee or its agent the bill of lading through mail or another means of communication. Any kind of carrier can issue a bill of lading, regardless of the transportation method (whether by land, water, or air). The carrier issues the bill of lading to the consignor at either: The place of shipment [x]. The destination point [y]. Any other designated place that the consignor requests. The carrier then delivers the goods covered in the bill of lading to either: The order of a consignor or consignee, if the bill of lading is negotiable (for an explanation of negotiable bills of lading, see Order Bill of Lading).

Submission of Trades, Orders and Contracts (A). Upon matching of a trade effected on or pursuant to the rules of the Exchange, the Exchange shall promptly submit to FreightTrust Clearing a trade report generated by the electronic trading system of the Exchange. The report shall show for each trade (i) the identity of each Clearing Participant and/or Network Participant, (ii) whether bought or sold, (iii) quantity, (iv) delivery month, (v) the price, (vi) whether for house, Customer, or non- Customer account, and (vii) such other information as may be required by FreightTrust Clearing. (B). If FreightTrust Clearing determines that any trade report submitted pursuant to this Rule 401 contains a material error or is otherwise not eligible for clearing by FreightTrust Clearing, FreightTrust Clearing may reject such trade and notify the Exchange of such rejection, setting forth the basis of such objection. 402. Clearance and Substitution. (a) The submission of a Contract (Smart Contract or a Normal Contract) to FreightTrust Clearing by or on behalf of the buying and selling Clearing Participants shall constitute a request, by such Clearing Participants, for the clearing of such Contract by FreightTrust Clearing. Upon the acceptance thereof by FreightTrust Clearing, which ordinarily shall be deemed to occur upon the receipt of matched trade data from the Exchange, the Contract shall be novated and FreightTrust Clearing shall be substituted as, and assume the position of, seller to the Clearing Participant buying such Contract and buyer from the Clearing Participant selling such Contract. Upon such substitution, such buying and selling Clearing Participants shall be released from their obligations to each other, and FreightTrust Clearing shall be deemed to have succeeded to all the rights, and to have assumed all the Obligations, of the Clearing Participants that were party to such Contract, in each case as provided in the Rules. (b) Where an FCM Clearing Participant and/or Network Participant acts to clear a Contract made for the account of a Customer, the FCM Clearing Participant becomes obligated to FreightTrust Clearing, and FreightTrust Clearing becomes obligated to the FCM Clearing Participant, with respect to such Contract in the same manner and to the same extent as if the Contract were for the account of the FCM Clearing Participant. (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), a trade shall not be accepted for clearing, and FreightTrust Clearing shall not be substituted for a given Contract, unless the Margin for such Contract is made available to FreightTrust Clearing, by or for both Clearing Participants, pursuant to Rule 403. 403. Margin (a) Each Network and Clearing Participant SHALL deposit funds or Collateral in the form of the applicable quantity of the deliverable underlying commodity and/or deliverable asset required to fully collateralize orders pursuant to the contract specifications contained in the Rulebook, including payment of premiums, payment in exchange for delivery or to fulfill delivery obligations, as applicable, prior to submission of such orders to the Exchange. Fund and Collateral transfers made by a Clearing Participant to the Clearinghouse or by the Clearinghouse to a Clearing Participant are irrevocable and unconditional when effected. The Clearing Participant shall be responsible for all fees associated with wires or transfers of Collateral to the Clearinghouse. (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of the Clearinghouse, Clearing Participants may deposit the following as Margin: (1) cash; (2) the underlying commodity; and (3) any other form of Collateral deemed acceptable by the Risk Management Committee upon the Risk Management Committee\u2019s approval of such Collateral as communicated through Clearinghouse notices. The Clearinghouse will value margin Collateral as it deems appropriate. (c) Funds and Collateral must be and remain unencumbered. Except as otherwise provided herein, each Clearing Participant posting funds or Collateral hereby grants to the Clearinghouse a first priority security interest in and unencumbered lien against any Margin, Contracts, positions and other funds, property and any other Collateral deposited with the Clearinghouse by the Clearing Participant, including without limitation such Clearing Participant\u2019s Member Property Accounts, the Customer Accounts of such Clearing Participant\u2019s Customers, and all securities entitlements held therein. A Clearing Participant shall execute any documents required by FreightTrust Clearing to create, perfect and enforce such lien. Each Clearing Participant hereby agrees that with respect to any funds or Collateral which is or may be credited to the Clearing Participant\u2019s Member Property Account or Customer Account, as applicable, the Clearinghouse shall have control pursuant to Section 9-106(a) and 8-106(e) of the UCC and a perfected security interest pursuant to Section 9-314(a) of the UCC.

(e) Clearing Participant must transfer the funds and Collateral to the Clearinghouse which will hold funds and Collateral on behalf of the Clearing Participant. FreightTrust Clearing will credit to the Clearing Participant the funds and Collateral that such Clearing Participant deposits. Funds and Collateral shall be held by the Clearinghouse until a Clearing Participant submits a withdrawal notification, unless otherwise stipulated by these Rules. FreightTrust Clearing will not be responsible for any diminution in value of funds or Collateral that a Clearing Participant deposits with the Clearinghouse, except, in the case of cash, the diminution of value is as a direct result of investment activity of the Clearinghouse, such activity having been conducted in full compliance with CFTC Regulations. Any fluctuation in markets is the risk of each Clearing Participant. Any interest earned on Clearing Participant funds or Collateral may be retained by the Clearinghouse. (f) If a Clearing Participant is in Default, FreightTrust Clearing may foreclose on and sell any of the Margin deposited by such Clearing Participant without notice. (g) FreightTrust Clearing shall be empowered to invest and reinvest all or part of the funds constituting Margin. Such investments shall be for the account and risk of FreightTrust Clearing, and any income and gains on such investments and interest on such deposits shall belong to FreightTrust Clearing and may be withdrawn from the account holding the Margin and deposited with the general funds of FreightTrust Clearing. 404. Offset and Settlement. (a) Where, as the result of novation under Rule 402, a Clearing Participant has bought and sold a Contract on or subject to the Rules of the Exchange with the same expiration, or otherwise deemed equivalent by the Clearinghouse, the purchase and sale will be offset by FreightTrust Clearing through the timely submission of instructions by the Clearing Participant containing such information as FreightTrust Clearing may require in accordance with its procedures. A Clearing Participant shall be required to pay the loss or entitled to collect the profit, as the case may be, upon such offsetting transactions, and shall have no further rights or be under any further obligation with respect thereto. For purposes of this Rule 404, the first Contracts made shall be deemed the first Contracts offset. (b) Contracts made and designated by the Network or Clearing Participant as for the Network and/or Clearing Participant\u2019s Customer Account shall not be offset under this Rule 405 against Contracts designated by the Clearing Participant as for the Clearing Participant\u2019s own Member Property Account. 405. Approved Depository Institutions. A bank, trust company or other depository that meets such financial and other requirements of FreightTrust Clearing may be designated by FreightTrust Clearing as an Approved Depository Institution. 406. Statement of Trades and Contracts. FreightTrust Clearing shall in the manner and at the time that it determines from time to time make available to a Clearing Participant an accounting of trades and Contracts for each Business Day on which such Clearing Participant has trades to be cleared or Contracts open with FreightTrust Clearing. Any amounts the Clearing Participant has posted to FreightTrust Clearing under Rule 403 shall be indicated on this statement 409. Settlement Prices. As used in the Rules, the term \u201cSettlement Price\u201d means the settlement price for a Contract for which positions remain open, as determined, intra-day and at the close of regular trading hours, by the Exchange in accordance with its rules, except in the case of manifest error or where FreightTrust Clearing believes that such settlement price does not reasonably reflect the value or price of the Contract, in which case FreightTrust Clearing, using its best efforts to consult with the Exchange, shall determine the official Settlement Price; provided, that FreightTrust Clearing shall in such circumstances promptly notify the Exchange and Clearing Participants, and the reasons for that determination and the basis for the Settlement Price determined by FreightTrust Clearing shall be published in a notice to the Exchange and Clearing Participants. 410. Delivery After trading ceases for a Smart Contract and/or Normal Contract that is physically settled, the Clearinghouse shall transfer the underlying to the Account of the Clearing Participant that is required to accept delivery, from the Account of the Clearing Participant obligated to make delivery, such full collateralization having been transferred to the Clearinghouse\u2019s custody at the inception of the trade. Deliveries will occur on the Clearinghouse\u2019s books and records unless otherwise specified in the Exchange contract specifications. 411. Reporting. Network and Clearing Participants shall make such reports in respect of trades, Smart Contracts, Normal Contracts settlements and deliveries as may be as prescribed by FreightTrust Clearing. 412.

Suspension General (A). The Board, Risk Management Committee, or any Exchange Committee may summarily suspend any Clearing Participant (i) if the Clearing Participant is in Default, (ii) upon the discovery of a materially false or misleading representation or warranty made by the Clearing Participant to FreightTrust Clearing under or in connection with any agreement between FreightTrust Clearing and the Clearing Participant, (iii) if a breach by the Clearing Participant of the Rules or any of the terms or provisions of any agreement between FreightTrust Clearing and the Clearing Participant is not remedied promptly after notice from FreightTrust Clearing, (iv) in the event of a material violation of the Rules of the Exchange or of the Clearinghouse, or (v) if the Board or the Risk Management Committee determines that suspension is necessary for the protection of FreightTrust Clearing, other Clearing Participants, or the general public (whether or not such Clearing Participant continues to meet the required minimum financial requirements pursuant to the Rules). (B). Notice of Suspension to Network and Clearing Participants Upon the suspension of a Clearing Participant, FreightTrust Clearing shall as soon as possible notify all Clearing Participants of the suspension. Such notice shall state to the extent practicable in general terms how pending transactions, open positions and other pending matters will be affected and what steps are to be taken in connection therewith. (C). Pending Transactions Notwithstanding any other provision of the Rules, FreightTrust Clearing shall have no obligation to accept any transaction of a suspended Network and/or Clearing Participant that was effected after the time at which the Clearing Participant was suspended. In the event a transaction of a suspended Clearing Participant is rejected by FreightTrust Clearing, FreightTrust Clearing shall provide notice of such rejection to the other party thereto and such transaction shall be closed by the other party thereto in accordance with the rules of the Exchange. (D). Open Positions FreightTrust Clearing shall have the right to cause open positions in Contracts in any of the accounts of a suspended Clearing Participant: (i) To be closed in such manner as deemed practicable by FreightTrust Clearing, in its sole discretion; (ii) To be transferred to the account of one or more other Clearing Participants; (iii) To be offset against each other and, to the extent of any remaining imbalance, against the Contracts of other Clearing Participants; or (iv) To be settled at the Settlement Price for such Contracts, or at such other price or prices as FreightTrust Clearing may deem fair and reasonable under the circumstances, in which event FreightTrust Clearing may cause Contracts in the accounts of other Clearing Participants to be settled at such price or prices; (v) Or take any other action with respect to open positions it deems in the best interest of the Clearinghouse or the Clearing Participants. In connection with any action undertaken by FreightTrust Clearing pursuant to subparagraphs (i) through (iv) above, FreightTrust Clearing shall have the right to apply the Margin of the applicable Clearing Participant and any other assets of such Clearing Participant held by, pledged to or otherwise available to FreightTrust Clearing, including any guarantee issued pursuant to these Rules, to discharge the Obligations of such Clearing Participant to FreightTrust Clearing (including any costs and expenses associated with the liquidation, transfer or management of Contracts held in or for the accounts of such Network and/or Clearing Participant, and any fees, assessments or fines imposed by FreightTrust Clearing on such Clearing Participant). FreightTrust Clearing may delegate to specified Officers or agents of FreightTrust Clearing the authority to determine, within such guidelines, if any, as FreightTrust Clearing shall prescribe, the nature and timing of transactions of the type described in subparagraph (i). Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this paragraph (d), if FreightTrust Clearing shall determine, taking into account the size and nature of a suspended Clearing Participant\u2019s positions, market conditions prevailing at the time, the potential market effects of liquidating transactions that might be directed by FreightTrust Clearing, and such other circumstances as FreightTrust Clearing deems relevant, that the closing out of some or all of the suspended Network and/or Clearing Participant\u2019s positions would not be in the best interests of FreightTrust Clearing, other Clearing Participants, or the general public, such positions need not be closed out. (E). Protective Action If FreightTrust Clearing (i) is unable, for any reason, to close out in a prompt and orderly manner any positions or to convert to cash any Margin deposits of a suspended Network and/or Clearing Participant, or (ii) elects pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Rule not to close out any such positions, FreightTrust Clearing may authorize the execution of hedging transactions from time to time for the account of FreightTrust Clearing, solely for the purpose of reducing the risk to FreightTrust Clearing resulting from the continued maintenance of such positions or the continued holding of such Margin deposits. FreightTrust Clearing may delegate to specified Officers or agents of FreightTrust Clearing the authority to determine, within such guidelines, if any, as FreightTrust Clearing shall prescribe, the nature and timing of such hedging transactions. (F). Reimbursement of Costs and Expenses Any costs or expenses, including losses, sustained by FreightTrust Clearing in connection with transactions effected for its account pursuant to this Rule shall be charged to the suspended Clearing Participant, and any gains realized on such transactions shall be credited to such Clearing Participant; provided, however, that costs, expenses, and gains allocable to the hedging of positions in a Customer Account shall be charged or credited, as the case may be, to the Customer Account, and only the excess, if any, of such costs and expenses over the funds available in that account shall be charged to the Clearing Participant. Reasonable allocations of costs, expenses, and gains among accounts made by FreightTrust Clearing for the purpose of implementing the proviso to the preceding sentence shall be binding on the Clearing Participant and any persons claiming through the Clearing Participant and their respective successors and assigns. 602. Right of Appeal. A Clearing Participant suspended pursuant to Rule 601 shall be entitled, upon request within five Business Days after the date of its suspension, to a written statement of the grounds for its suspension and shall have the right to appeal its suspension in accordance with the following procedure: (A). A suspended Clearing Participant may appeal its suspension by filing a written notice of appeal within five Business Days after the date of its receipt of a written statement of the grounds for its suspension.

The appellant shall be notified in writing of the Appeal Panel\u2019s decision; and if the decision shall have been to affirm or modify the suspension, the appellant shall be given a written statement of the grounds therefor. (C).

The appellant shall be notified in writing of the decision of the Board; and if the decision shall have been to affirm or modify the suspension, the appellant shall be given a written statement of the grounds therefor. (D). The filing of an appeal pursuant to this Rule shall not impair the validity or stay the effect of the suspension appealed from. The reversal or modification of a suspension shall not invalidate any acts of FreightTrust Clearing taken pursuant to such suspension prior to such reversal or modification, and the rights of any person which may arise out of any such acts shall not be affected by such reversal or modification. (E). A record shall be kept of any hearing held pursuant hereto. The cost of the transcript may, in the discretion of the body holding the hearing, be charged in whole or in part to the suspended Clearing Participant in the event that the suspension is finally affirmed. 603.

(B). FreightTrust Clearing shall provide prompt notice to the CFTC of any action taken in accordance with this Rule 603. 604. Procedures for Disciplinary Proceedings. (A). Before any sanction is imposed pursuant to Rule 603, FreightTrust Clearing shall furnish the person against whom the sanction is sought to be imposed (\u201cRespondent\u201d) with a concise written statement of the charges against the Respondent. The Respondent shall have ten Business Days after the service of such statement to file with FreightTrust Clearing a written answer thereto. The answer shall admit or deny each allegation contained in the statement of charges and may also contain any defense which the Respondent wishes to submit. Allegations contained in the statement of charges which are not denied in the answer shall be deemed to have been admitted, and any defense not raised in the answer shall be deemed to have been waived. If an answer is not filed within the time prescribed above or any extension thereof granted pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Rule, the allegations contained in the statement of charges shall be deemed to have been admitted, and the sanction specified in the final request shall be imposed without further proceedings and the Respondent shall be notified thereof in writing. If an answer is timely filed, FreightTrust Clearing shall (unless the Respondent and FreightTrust Clearing shall have stipulated to the imposition of an agreed sanction) schedule a hearing before the Disciplinary Panel. The Respondent shall be given not less than three Business Days advance notice of the place and time of such hearing. At the hearing, the Respondent shall be afforded the opportunity to be heard and to present evidence in its behalf and may be represented by counsel. A record of the hearing shall be prepared and the cost of the transcript may, in the discretion of the Disciplinary Panel, be charged in whole or in part to the Respondent in the event any sanction is imposed on the Respondent. As soon as practicable after the conclusion of the hearing, the Disciplinary Panel shall furnish the Respondent and the Board with a written statement of its decision. If the decision shall have been to impose a disciplinary sanction, the written statement shall set forth (i) any act or practice in which the Respondent has been found to have engaged, or which the Respondent has been found to have omitted; (ii) the specific provisions of the Rules which any such act, practice or omission has been deemed to violate; and (iii) the sanction imposed and the reasons therefor. (B). In the event that (i) the Disciplinary Panel censures, fines, suspends, expels or limits the activities, functions or operations of a Respondent, or (ii) determines not to impose any disciplinary measures on a Respondent, the Respondent, in the case of (i) above, or the President, in the case of (ii) above, may apply for review to the Board, by written motion filed with FreightTrust Clearing within five Business Days after issuance of the Disciplinary Panel\u2019s written statement of its decision. (C). The granting of any such motion shall be within the discretion of the Board. In addition, the Board may determine to review any such action by the Disciplinary Panel on its own motion. Review by the Board shall be on the basis of the written record of the proceedings in which the sanction was imposed, but the Board may, in its discretion, afford the Respondent a further opportunity to be heard or to present evidence. A record shall be kept of any such further proceedings. Based upon such review, the Board may affirm, reverse or modify, in whole or in part, the decision of the Disciplinary Panel. The Respondent shall be notified in writing of the decision of the Board and if the decision shall have been to affirm or modify the imposition of any disciplinary sanction, the Respondent shall be given a written statement setting forth (i) any act or practice in which the Respondent has been found to have engaged, or which the Respondent has been found to have omitted; (ii) the Rules which any such act, practice or omission has been deemed to violate; and (iii) the sanction imposed and the reasons therefor. (D). Any time limit set forth in this Rule may be extended by the body having jurisdiction over the matter in respect of which the time limit is imposed. (E). Any action taken by the Disciplinary Panel hereunder shall be deemed to be final upon (i) expiration of the time provided for the filing of a motion for review, or any extension thereof granted pursuant to paragraph (d) hereof; or (ii) if a motion for review is timely filed, when the Respondent is notified of the denial of the motion or the decision of the Board on review, as the case may be; or (iii) if the Board shall determine on its own motion to review the action by the Disciplinary Panel, when the Respondent is notified of the decision of the Board on review. (F). The summary suspension of a Clearing Participant pursuant to Rule 601 shall not be deemed to be a \u201csanction\u201d within the meaning of this Rule, and the provisions of this Rule shall be inapplicable to any such summary suspension. 605. Discipline by Other Self-Regulatory Organizations. (A). At the discretion of the Clearinghouse, any suspected violation of these Rules may be referred to the enforcement staff of the Exchange. (B). Any inquiry, investigation or disciplinary action resulting from a suspected violation of these Rules may be handled by Clearinghouse personnel, Exchange personnel, or personnel that serve in roles at both the Clearinghouse and the Exchange. (C). Nothing in this Chapter 6 shall affect the right of any Self-Regulatory Organization to discipline its members pursuant to the provisions of its rules for a violation of the Rules of FreightTrust Clearing. 606. Restriction on or Termination of Clearing Privileges. (A). If [x] a Removal Event occurs with respect to a Clearing Participant, or [y]FreightTrust Clearing determines that the financial or operational condition of a Clearing Participant or one of its affiliates is such that to allow the Clearing Participant to continue its operation as a Clearing Participant could adversely affect FreightTrust Clearing or cleared markets (whether or not such Clearing Participant continues to meet the required minimum financial requirements, if applicable), FreightTrust Clearing may: (i) Allow such Clearing Participant (in the case of an FCM Clearing Participant handling Customer Accounts) to submit Contracts for clearing solely for its Member Property Account; (ii) Limit or restrict the type of Contracts that may be cleared by such Clearing Participant in any of its Accounts with FreightTrust Clearing; (iii) Limit or restrict the number of Contracts that are permitted to be maintained by such Clearing Participant in any of its Accounts with FreightTrust Clearing; (iv) Decline to accept new trades or positions in Contracts for the Accounts of the Clearing Participant; (v) Increase such Clearing Participant\u2019s Margin requirements and/or require such Clearing Participant to deposit the same in cash or Eligible Securities in proportions different than those that are applicable to Clearing Participants generally;","title":"Suspension; Disciplinary Proceedings"},{"location":"rulebook/6-suspension/#suspension-disciplinary-proceedings","text":"Warning Please See our Master Covenent Agreement","title":"Suspension; Disciplinary Proceedings"},{"location":"rulebook/6-suspension/#601-suspension","text":"","title":"601.

The purpose of this contributor agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d) is to clarify and document the rights granted by contributors to Us. To make this document effective, please follow the instructions at freighttrust.com/cla-agreement. 0. Preamble Software is deeply embedded in all aspects of our lives and it is important that it empower, rather than restrict us. Free Software gives everybody the rights to use, understand, adapt and share software. These rights help support other fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech, press and privacy. Development of Free Software can follow many patterns. In some cases whole development is handled by a sole programmer or a small group of people. But usually, the creation and maintenance of software is a complex process that requires the contribution of many individuals. This also affects who owns the rights to the software. In the latter case, rights in software are owned jointly by a great number of individuals. To tackle this issue some projects require a full copyright assignment to be signed by all contributors. The problem with such assignments is that they often lack checks and balances that would protect the contributors from potential abuse of power from the new copyright holder. FSFE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fiduciary License Agreement (FLA) was created by the Free Software Foundation Europe e.V. with just that in mind \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to concentrate all deciding power within one entity and prevent fragmentation of rights on one hand, while on the other preventing that single entity from abusing its power. The main aim is to ensure that the software covered under the FLA will forever remain Free Software. This process only serves for the transfer of economic rights. So-called moral rights (e.g. authors right to be identified as author) remain with the original author(s) and are inalienable. How to use this FLA If You are an employee and have created the Contribution as part of your employment, You need to have Your employer approve this Agreement or sign the Entity version of this document. If You do not own the Copyright in the entire work of authorship, any other author of the Contribution should also sign this \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in any event, please contact Us at admin@freighttrust.com 1. Definitions \u201cYou\u201d means the individual Copyright owner who Submits a Contribution to Us. \u201cContribution\u201d means any original work of authorship, including any original modifications or additions to an existing work of authorship, Submitted by You to Us, in which You own the Copyright. \u201cCopyright\u201d means all rights protecting works of authorship, including copyright, moral and neighboring rights, as appropriate, for the full term of their existence. \u201cMaterial\u201d means the software or documentation made available by Us to third parties. When this Agreement covers more than one software project, the Material means the software or documentation to which the Contribution was Submitted.

Applicability. ${NAME OF WAREHOUSE OPERATOR} (\u201cWarehouse Operator\u201d) shall provide warehousing, storage, handling, delivery, and related services (the \u201cServices\u201d) for the goods described on the face side hereof (the \u201cGoods\u201d) on behalf of the depositor named on the face side hereof (\u201cDepositor\u201d) pursuant to these terms and conditions, together with the quotations, terms, and conditions contained on the face side of this document (collectively, this \u201cWarehouse Receipt\u201d). Warehouse Operator shall provide the Services in its warehouse facility identified on the face side hereof (\u201cWarehouse\u201d). If Warehouse Operator provides additional services, including the special handling services set forth on the face side hereof, it shall provide them (a) for the additional fees set forth in Section 7, and (b) solely as agent for Depositor, and not as a bailee or warehouseman. \u00a7 2. Acceptance. This Warehouse Receipt must be accepted within [NUMBER] days from the proposal date set forth on the face side of this document (\u201cProposal Date\u201d) either by Depositor\u2019s signature, or in the absence of written acceptance, Depositor\u2019s tender of Goods for storage hereunder within [NUMBER] days from the Proposal Date. Depositor\u2019s tender of Goods for storage is subject to the terms and conditions of this Warehouse Receipt, including Section 3. Warehouse Operator may refuse to accept any goods for storage if (a) the Goods are tendered for storage after ${NUMBER} days from the Proposal Date without prior written acceptance by the Depositor under this Section 2; or (b) the goods tendered forstorage do not conform to the description contained on the face side hereof. If Warehouse Operator accepts such goods for storage, Depositor agrees to rates and charges as may be assigned and invoiced by Warehouse Operator and to all other terms and conditions of this Warehouse Receipt. Any goods accepted by Warehouse Operator, including additional goods delivered by Depositor as part of this lot while this Warehouse Receipt is outstanding, constitute Goods under this Warehouse Receipt. \u00a7 3. Tender of Goods for Storage. Depositor represents and warrants that it is the owner or has lawful possession of the Goods and all right and authority to store them with Warehouse Operator and thereafter direct the release and/or delivery of the Goods. Depositor shall (a) tender any Goods for storage only during Warehouse Operator's posted business hours for the Warehouse; (b) tender all Goods to the Warehouse properly marked and packed for storage and handling; (c) provide Warehouse Operator with information concerning the tendered goods that is accurate, complete, and sufficient to allow Warehouse Operator to comply with all laws and regulations concerning the storage, handling, processing, and transportation of the Goods; and (d) furnish at or prior to tender of the Goods for storage a manifest in a form approved by Warehouse Operator listing any categories of Goods, brands, or sizes to be separately kept and accounted for. Before tendering Goods that require specialized handling or which are dangerous or hazardous, Depositor must identify the Goods and special handling requirements to Warehouse Operator in writing, and Warehouse Operator must specifically agree to store such Goods. Depositor is solely responsible for providing complete and accurate handling and storage instructions for such Goods, including any applicable safety procedures. If such Goods create a risk of harm to persons or property, or if continued storage becomes impractical, Warehouse Operator may require Depositor to take delivery of such Goods, or may dispose of such Goods at Depositor\u2019s risk and expense. (a) For all Goods shipped to the Warehouse, Depositor shall ensure that the bill of lading or other contract of carriage (\u201cTransportation Contract\u201d) (a) identifies Depositor as the named consignee, in care of Warehouse Operator, and (b) does not identify Warehouse Operator as the consignee. If any Goods are shipped to the Warehouse naming Warehouse Operator as named consignee on the Transportation Contract, Depositor shall promptly notify the carrier in writing that Warehouse is (x) the \u201cin care of party\u201d only and (y) does not have any beneficial title or interest in the Goods. Warehouse Operator may refuse to accept any Goods tendered for storage in violation of this provision, and shall not be liable for any loss or damage to, or misconsignment of, such Goods. Depositor agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Warehouse Operator harmless from any costs, liabilities, actions, penalties, or expenses of any kinds associated with the improper declaration of Warehouse Operator as consignee. \u00a7 4. Indemnity. Depositor shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Warehouse Operator [and its [officers,] [directors,] employees, agents, affiliates, successors, and permitted assigns] (collectively, \u201cIndemnified Party\u201d) against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including undercharges, rail demurrage, truck/intermodal detention or related charges and [reasonable] attorneys\u2019 fees, fees, and the costs of enforcing any right to indemnification under this Warehouse Receipt and the cost of pursuing any insurance providers, [incurred by Indemnified Party/awarded against Indemnified Party], [relating to/arising out of or resulting from] any claim of a third party [or Warehouse Operator] arising out of or occurring in connection with the Services or from Warehouse Operator\u2019s or Depositor\u2019s negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of this Warehouse Receipt (each, a \u201cWarehouse Claim\u201d). Depositor shall not enter into any settlement of a Warehouse Claim without Warehouse Operator\u2019s or Indemnified Party\u2019s prior written consent. 5. Access and Release of Goods. Warehouse Operator shall use all reasonable efforts to release the Goods to Depositor or its designee within a reasonable time after Warehouse Operator\u2019s receipt of Depositor\u2019s written instructions to do so (each, a \u201cRelease Order\u201d), provided that all charges have been paid in full. Warehouse Operator may without liability rely on any information contained in any instructions or other communication from Depositor. 501. Depositor. Depositor shall be responsible for all shipping, handling, and other charges assessed by carriers and other third parties in connection with the delivery and/or other shipment of the Goods. A Release Order providing instructions to transfer Goods on the books of Warehouse Operator to any other depositor of goods in the Warehouse will not be effective until such Release Order is delivered to and accepted by Warehouse Operator. The depositor of record shall be responsible for all charges up to the time the actual transfer of the applicable Goods is made. When Goods in storage are transferred from one party to another through issuance of a new warehouse receipt, a new storage date for the transferee will be established effective on the date of transfer. Warehouse Operator may move, upon [NUMBER] days\u2019 notice to Depositor any Goods in storage from the Warehouse to any of the other warehouses belonging to or operated by Warehouse Operator. Warehouse Operator may, without notice, move the Goods within the Warehouse in which the Goods are stored. 6. Warehouse Lien. Warehouse Operator shall have a lien on the Goods and upon the proceeds from the sale thereof to secure Depositor\u2019s payment of all fees, charges, and expenses hereunder in connection with the storage, transportation, preservation, and handling of the Goods. Warehouse Operator may enforce this lien at any time, including, by selling all or any part of the Goods in accordance with applicable law. 7. Storage Charges. Depositor shall pay the storage charges and service fees at the rates set forth on [the face side hereof/Warehouse Operator\u2019s Rate Sheet in effect at the time such charges accrue or the services are performed]. All Goods are stored on a month-to-month basis. All charges for storage are per package, or other unit specified on the face side hereof, per month. [Warehouse Operator may, upon thirty days written notice, revise its rates during the time the Goods are in storage.] The current Rate Sheet shall be provided at the time of deposit of Goods into storage and upon request by Depositor. Notwithstanding the above, (a) a full month\u2019s storage charge will apply to all Goods received between the first and the 15th, inclusive, of a calendar month; (b) one-half month\u2019s storage charge will apply to all Goods received between the 16th and last day, inclusive, of a calendar month; and (c) a full month\u2019s storage charge will apply to all Goods in storage on the first day of a calendar month. Standard services are limited to the ordinary labor involved in receiving tendered Goods at the warehouse door, placing Goods in storage, and returning Goods (that are to be dispatched from the Warehouse) to warehouse door. Additional charges apply to other specified services at the rates set forth on [the face side hereof/Warehouse Operator\u2019s Rate Sheet in effect at the time such charges accrue or the services are performed], and will be separately billed as such services are performed. All charges are exclusive of all sales, use, and excise taxes, and any other similar taxes, duties and charges of any kind imposed by any governmental authority on any amounts payable by Depositor. Depositor shall be responsible for all such charges, costs, and taxes; provided, that, Depositor shall not be responsible for any taxes imposed on, or with respect to, Warehouse Operator\u2019s income, revenues, gross receipts, personnel, or real or personal property. Depositor is subject to and shall pay the minimum handling charge per lot and a minimum storage charge per lot per month specified on [the face side hereof/Warehouse Operator\u2019s Rate Sheet in effect at the time such charge accrues or the services are performed]. === [2] ACCEPTANCE A warehouse receipt is a document prepared by the warehouse operator containing its quoted rates and other terms and conditions. It is treated as an offer to enter into a contract that must be accepted by the depositor to form a contract. This Standard Document provides for two methods of acceptance: - Acceptance by countersignature. The depositor can signify its acceptance of the offer by countersigning the warehouse receipt on the face side of the document and returning an executed copy within the specified number of days after the offer is made (proposal date). - Acceptance by tender of goods. If the depositor does not countersign the warehouse receipt, the warehouse receipt is deemed accepted when the depositor tenders the goods referred to in the warehouse receipt and accepts the warehouse receipt issued. The warehouse operator is under no obligation to accept tender of any goods if the depositor has not proffered its acceptance by timely countersignature or tender of goods. Any untimely tender of goods by the depositor is treated as an offer by the depositor to enter into a contract under the terms and conditions of the warehouse receipt, which the warehouse operator can accept by accepting tender of the goods. Therefore, any goods tendered in the manner contemplated by Section 2 and accepted by the warehouse operator constitute goods that are subject to all the terms and conditions of the warehouse receipt. [3] TENDER OF GOODS FOR STORAGE Section 3 sets out some of the basic ground rules to the proper tender of goods for storage. The depositor must: Confirm that it has the right to store the goods with the warehouse operator. Tender the goods only during the normal business hours of the warehouse. To ensure that all goods are properly accounted for, the depositor must also: Properly pack the goods for storage, including affixing proper labels. Provide the warehouse operator with a manifest with detailed information about each tender of goods. The second paragraph helps to reduce the risk that any transportation provider that delivers the goods to the warehouse on behalf of the depositor can make a claim against the warehouse operator for payment of transportation charges by requiring the depositor to: - Identify the warehouse operator as a service provider, rather than the owner of the goods. - Notify and correct any potential misunderstanding of the carrier that the warehouse operator may have title or an interest in the goods. [4] INDEMNITY This pro-warehouse operator Standard Document contains a one-way indemnity by the depositor in favor of the warehouse operator. The indemnity covers claims arising out of or incurred in connection with the warehouse receipt, including any breach of the warehouse receipt by the depositor for example, any breach of Section 3 resulting in any losses incurred by the warehouse operator due to: - Its involvement in a third-party claim that is adverse to the depositor\u2019s rights in the goods. - Any claim by a carrier for transportation charges that should rightfully be borne by the depositor. The bracketed definition of indemnified party includes third parties. Therefore, if the warehouse operator wants to ensure that those third parties can seek remedies under this indemnification provision, it should carve them out from Section 14. [5] ACCESS & RELEASE OF GOODS he warehouse operator is also entitled to rely on information and directions received from the depositor concerning the depositor\u2019s goods. This clause aims to ensure that the warehouse operator: - Is not strictly held to any specific deadlines. - Has flexibility in its ability to move stored goods within the warehouse the goods are in or to other warehouses operated by the warehouse operator. [6] WAREHOUSE LIEN Section 6 confirms that the warehouse operator has a statutory lien under UCC Article 7 in the warehoused goods to secure the depositor\u2019s obligation to pay the storage and related charges set out in Section 7 (UCC \u00a7 7-209(a)). Section 11 gives the warehouse operator the right to terminate the agreement if the goods are about to deteriorate or decline in value to less than the amount of the warehouse lien set out in Section 5 before the end of the next succeeding storage month. Third-party lenders, including vendors that provide purchase money financing to the depositor, however, typically want assurances from the depositor that the depositor can provide the lender a first priority security interest in any warehoused goods. Therefore, as a condition to financing, the lender typically requires the depositor to obtain the warehouse operator\u2019s: Agreement that the lender\u2019s security interest prevails over any lien or security interest that the warehouse operator may have in the warehoused goods.

[7] STORAGE CHARGES The warehouse operator can incorporate pricing information in: - The face side of the warehouse receipt. - The warehouse operator\u2019s then current price list. Many warehouse operators prefer to set their prices by reference to a price list because it: - Provides them with greater flexibility. - Avoids the need for a price adjustment clause. Section 7 identifies a monthly billing period, although the warehouse operator is free to specify some other period of time, for example, biweekly or quarterly. This Standard Document contemplates the provision of standard storage and related services. Special services are subject to additional charges that the warehouse operator can include on the face side of the warehouse receipt or on its rate schedule. Special services might include: - Inspecting the goods. - Unloading damaged goods - Receiving or delivering goods outside of normal business hours. - Reporting serial numbers, marked weights, or other data from packages. - Supplying packing materials or other special supplies. - Furnishing special communications to or on behalf of the depositor, for example, by overnight courier. - Furnishing insurance on the goods.","title":"NON-NEGOTIABLE WAREHOUSE RECEIPT"},{"location":"warehouse/non-negotiable-warehouse-receipt/#non-negotiable-warehouse-receipt","text":"","title":"NON-NEGOTIABLE WAREHOUSE RECEIPT"},{"location":"warehouse/non-negotiable-warehouse-receipt/#1-applicability","text":"${NAME OF WAREHOUSE OPERATOR} (\u201cWarehouse Operator\u201d) shall provide warehousing, storage, handling, delivery, and related services (the \u201cServices\u201d) for the goods described on the face side hereof (the \u201cGoods\u201d) on behalf of the depositor named on the face side hereof (\u201cDepositor\u201d) pursuant to these terms and conditions, together with the quotations, terms, and conditions contained on the face side of this document (collectively, this \u201cWarehouse Receipt\u201d).

Depositor is subject to and shall pay the minimum handling charge per lot and a minimum storage charge per lot per month specified on [the face side hereof/Warehouse Operator\u2019s Rate Sheet in effect at the time such charge accrues or the services are performed]. === [2] ACCEPTANCE A warehouse receipt is a document prepared by the warehouse operator containing its quoted rates and other terms and conditions. It is treated as an offer to enter into a contract that must be accepted by the depositor to form a contract. This Standard Document provides for two methods of acceptance: - Acceptance by countersignature. The depositor can signify its acceptance of the offer by countersigning the warehouse receipt on the face side of the document and returning an executed copy within the specified number of days after the offer is made (proposal date). - Acceptance by tender of goods. If the depositor does not countersign the warehouse receipt, the warehouse receipt is deemed accepted when the depositor tenders the goods referred to in the warehouse receipt and accepts the warehouse receipt issued. The warehouse operator is under no obligation to accept tender of any goods if the depositor has not proffered its acceptance by timely countersignature or tender of goods. Any untimely tender of goods by the depositor is treated as an offer by the depositor to enter into a contract under the terms and conditions of the warehouse receipt, which the warehouse operator can accept by accepting tender of the goods. Therefore, any goods tendered in the manner contemplated by Section 2 and accepted by the warehouse operator constitute goods that are subject to all the terms and conditions of the warehouse receipt. [3] TENDER OF GOODS FOR STORAGE Section 3 sets out some of the basic ground rules to the proper tender of goods for storage. The depositor must: Confirm that it has the right to store the goods with the warehouse operator. Tender the goods only during the normal business hours of the warehouse. To ensure that all goods are properly accounted for, the depositor must also: Properly pack the goods for storage, including affixing proper labels. Provide the warehouse operator with a manifest with detailed information about each tender of goods. The second paragraph helps to reduce the risk that any transportation provider that delivers the goods to the warehouse on behalf of the depositor can make a claim against the warehouse operator for payment of transportation charges by requiring the depositor to: - Identify the warehouse operator as a service provider, rather than the owner of the goods. - Notify and correct any potential misunderstanding of the carrier that the warehouse operator may have title or an interest in the goods. [4] INDEMNITY This pro-warehouse operator Standard Document contains a one-way indemnity by the depositor in favor of the warehouse operator. The indemnity covers claims arising out of or incurred in connection with the warehouse receipt, including any breach of the warehouse receipt by the depositor for example, any breach of Section 3 resulting in any losses incurred by the warehouse operator due to: - Its involvement in a third-party claim that is adverse to the depositor\u2019s rights in the goods. - Any claim by a carrier for transportation charges that should rightfully be borne by the depositor. The bracketed definition of indemnified party includes third parties. Therefore, if the warehouse operator wants to ensure that those third parties can seek remedies under this indemnification provision, it should carve them out from Section 14. [5] ACCESS & RELEASE OF GOODS he warehouse operator is also entitled to rely on information and directions received from the depositor concerning the depositor\u2019s goods. This clause aims to ensure that the warehouse operator: - Is not strictly held to any specific deadlines. - Has flexibility in its ability to move stored goods within the warehouse the goods are in or to other warehouses operated by the warehouse operator. [6] WAREHOUSE LIEN Section 6 confirms that the warehouse operator has a statutory lien under UCC Article 7 in the warehoused goods to secure the depositor\u2019s obligation to pay the storage and related charges set out in Section 7 (UCC \u00a7 7-209(a)). Section 11 gives the warehouse operator the right to terminate the agreement if the goods are about to deteriorate or decline in value to less than the amount of the warehouse lien set out in Section 5 before the end of the next succeeding storage month. Third-party lenders, including vendors that provide purchase money financing to the depositor, however, typically want assurances from the depositor that the depositor can provide the lender a first priority security interest in any warehoused goods. Therefore, as a condition to financing, the lender typically requires the depositor to obtain the warehouse operator\u2019s: Agreement that the lender\u2019s security interest prevails over any lien or security interest that the warehouse operator may have in the warehoused goods. Acknowledgement that it does not have any rights in the goods that would interfere with the lender\u2019s first priority security interest. Authentication that it holds or acknowledges that it will hold possession of the warehoused goods for the lender\u2019s benefit to overcome any presumption that the warehouse operator may have a possessory security interest in the goods (UCC \u00a7 9-313(c)(1) and (c)(2)). [7] STORAGE CHARGES The warehouse operator can incorporate pricing information in: - The face side of the warehouse receipt. - The warehouse operator\u2019s then current price list. Many warehouse operators prefer to set their prices by reference to a price list because it: - Provides them with greater flexibility. - Avoids the need for a price adjustment clause.
