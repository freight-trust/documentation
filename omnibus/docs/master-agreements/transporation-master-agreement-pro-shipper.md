consent may be given or withheld in Customer's sole discretion,]] subcontract with [any Person, other than Carrier's employees/the persons

contractual relationship between Customer and any subcontractor.

relationship between the Parties. Carrier is an independent contractor under this Agreement. Neither Party has any express or implied right or

(a) Each Shipment under this Agreement shall be evidenced by a delivery receipt in the form specified by Customer, which shall be
signed by Carrier or its agent or employee showing the kind and quantity of Goods received by Carrier at the Pick-up Location, but the
absence or loss of such receipt shall not relieve Carrier of its obligations and responsibilities under this Agreement.

Lading"), any terms and conditions of such Bill of Lading shall be subject to Section 3.3.

### Appendix 

#### TRANSPORTATION SERVICES
This Standard Document sets out a basic definition of the services to be provided by the carrier. The parties must revise this definition (or
use a different form of agreement) if the carrier will provide additional or specialized services, for example:
- Temporary warehouse services.
- Rail transportation.
- Air transportation.
- Waterway transportation.
- Pipeline transportation.
- Refrigerated transportation.
- Expedited service.


[2] PROVISION OF TRANSPORT SERVIES
This Document acknowledges that carriers employ a variety of order and acceptance procedures, which may include:
Manually implemented systems utilizing the customer's shipment request and carrier's acceptances.
Either the carrier's or customer's electronic data platform.
When the carrier agrees to provide the transportation services at its cost and expense, it is agreeing to assume all costs and
expenses incident to the transportation of shipments. This includes all costs of fuel and insurance, as well as incident to or arising out
of the maintenance, repair or operation of its trucks and other equipment. If there are any out-of-pocket or other costs that are not
covered as overhead by the purchase price of the transportation services, and which the carrier would like to pass along to the
customer (for example, any fuel surcharge), it must be sure to clarify the allocation in Section 8.

SUBCONTRACTING:
The parties must negotiate:
Whether to allow the carrier to subcontract some or all of the transportation services.
If the parties allow the carrier to subcontract:
how much discretion the carrier has in its choice of subcontractor; and
the conditions that must be satisfied.

[3] Carrier's Right to Reject Shipment Requests
This pro-customer Standard Document does not give the carrier the right to reject shipment requests. The customer can expect the carrier
to negotiate the right to accept or reject shipment requests. If the customer agrees to give the carrier the right to reject shipment requests,
it should negotiate to restrict the carrier's discretion based on objective criteria, for example:
The customer's credit status.
The size of the request.
Whether the carrier has the capacity.
In addition, the customer may want to require the carrier to:
Accept the shipment request within a certain period of time.
Notify the customer in writing of any rejection or cancellation within a certain period of time.

[5] CARRIER BEARS RISK OF LOSS
In this provision, the carrier undertakes to bear the entire risk of loss, damage or injury to the goods.
Since the carrier bears the risk of loss, it must compensate the customer for any loss either:
Directly.
Through the proceeds of any cargo insurance maintained by the carrier under Section 6.1(b).
The bracketed language anticipates that the carrier will attempt to limit its liability by excluding loss, damage or injury resulting from acts
beyond its control. The parties can define the acts beyond the carrier's control either by:
Referencing to the definition of Force Majeure Event.
Listing the acts specifically.

[6] Insurance coverage enables:
The carrier to mitigate its financial exposure to the specified risk by shifting the risk to its insurer, in exchange for an insurance premium that
usually represents a fraction of the total coverage the policy provides.
The customer to limit its risk that the carrier does not have the financial capacity to cover its liabilities under the contract.
This Standard Document assumes that the carrier is a contract carrier, which is not required to maintain all types of insurance. However,
this Standard Document aims to be reasonable by imposing the contractual requirement that the carrier procure and maintain at least:
* Liability insurance (see Section 6.1(a)).
* Property insurance (see Section 6.1(b).)

Deductibles. A policy that has a deductible reduces the total amount of coverage provided by the policy by the amount of the deductible. For
example, an insurance policy providing $200,000 in coverage with a $10,000 deductible would cover $190,000 worth of any loss suffered by the
policyholder in excess of the $10,000 deductible.
SIRs. A SIR does not reduce policy limits, but must be satisfied before the policy limits can be tapped. A policy that has a SIR requires the
policyholder to incur a loss in excess of the SIR amount before coverage is triggered, but will then cover up to the full amount of coverage. For
example, a $200,000 insurance policy with a $10,000 SIR would provide a full $200,000 worth of coverage after the policyholder had paid
$10,000 to satisfy the SIR.
